A key challenge for wider adoption of probabilistic programming languages is designing systems that are both flexible and performant. This paper introduces Gen, a new probabilistic programming system with novel language con- structs for modeling and for end-user customization and optimization of inference. Gen makes it practical to write probabilistic programs that solve problems from multiple fields. Gen programs can combine generative models written in Julia, neural networks written in TensorFlow, and custom inference algorithms based on an extensible library of Monte Carlo and numerical optimization techniques. This paper also presents techniques that enable Gen’s combination of flexibility and performance: (i) the generative function inter- face, an abstraction for encapsulating probabilistic and/or differentiable computations; (ii) domain-specific languages with custom compilers that strike different flexibility/per- formance tradeoffs; (iii) combinators that encode common patterns of conditional independence and repeated compu- tation, enabling speedups from caching; and (iv) a standard inference library that supports custom proposal distributions also written as programs in Gen. This paper shows that Gen outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic programming systems, sometimes by multiple orders of magnitude, on problems such as nonlinear state-space modeling, structure learning for real-world time series data, robust regression, and 3D body pose estimation from depth images.","This research was supported in part by the US Department of the Air Force contract FA8750-17-C-0239, grants from the MIT Media Lab/Harvard Berkman Center Ethics & Gover- nance of AI Fund and the MIT CSAIL Systems that Learn Consortium, a gift from the Aphorism Foundation, and the US Department of Defense through the the National De- fense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG) Program.",en_US,;MIT-CSAIL-TR-2018-020,Gen: A General-Purpose Probabilistic Programming System with Programmable Inference,Article,,,,,,,,,,

Our work provides a dynamic controllability checker that is able to quickly refute the controllability of an STNU with integer bounds, such as those found in planning problems. Our work is faster than the existing best runtime for networks with integer bounds and executes in O(min(mn, m\sqrt{n}\log{N}) + km + k^2n + kn\log{n}).

We present a new system, ClearScope, that tracks, at the level of individual bytes, the complete paths that data follow through Android systems. These paths include the original source where data entered the device (such as sensors or network connections), files in which the data was temporarily stored, applications that the data traversed during its time in the device, and sinks through which the data left the device.

The ClearScope system design enables this unprecedented level of provenance tracking detail by 1) structuring the provenance representation as references, via provenance tags, to provenance events that record the movement of data between system components and into or out of the device and 2) adopting a split design in which provenance events are streamed to a remote server for storage, with only the minimal information required to generate the tagged stream of events retained on the device. ClearScope also includes compiler optimizations that enable efficient provenance tracking within applications by eliminating unnecessary provenance tracking computations and adopting and efficient aggregate provenance representation for arrays when all array elements have the same provenance.

Experience using ClearScope to analyze the notorious Adups FOTA malware highlights the significant benefits that this level of comprehensive detail can bring.

Software signing provides authenticity, mitigating many such attacks. Developer- managed signing keys pose usability challenges, but certificate- based systems introduce privacy problems. This work, Speranza, uses certificates to verify software authenticity but still provides anonymity to signers using zero-knowledge identity co-commitments.
In Speranza, a signer uses an automated certificate authority (CA) to create a private identity-bound signature and proof of authoriza- tion. Verifiers check that a signer was authorized to publish a pack- age without learning the signer’s identity. The package repository privately records each package’s authorized signers, but publishes only commitments to identities in a public map. Then, when issuing certificates, the CA issues the certificate to a distinct commitment to the same identity. The signer then creates a zero-knowledge proof that these are identity co-commitments.
We implemented a proof-of-concept for Speranza. We find that costs to maintainers (signing) and end users (verifying) are small (sub-millisecond), even for a repository with millions of packages. Techniques inspired by recent key transparency systems reduce the bandwidth for serving authorization policies to 2 KiB. Server costs in this system are negligible. Our evaluation finds that Speranza is practical on the scale of the largest software repositories.
We also emphasize practicality and deployability in this project. By building on existing technology and employing relatively sim- ple and well-established cryptographic techniques, Speranza can be deployed for wide-scale use with only a few hundred lines of code and minimal changes to existing infrastructure.
