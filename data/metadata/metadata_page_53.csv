In a nutshell, they require the existence of pseudo-random generators $G:\Sigma^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ for some $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-size alphabet $\Sigma$ where each output bit depends on at most two input alphabet symbols, and which achieve sufficiently large stretch. We show a polynomial-time attack against such generators. Our attack uses tools from the literature on two-source extractors (Chor and Goldreich, SICOMP 1988) and efficient refutation of 2-CSPs over large alphabets (Allen, O'Donnell and Witmer, FOCS 2015).

This complexity is especially inappropriate given the relatively simple core functionality that many of the computations implement. We present a new approach for obtaining so ware that executes on modern computing platforms with complex programming interfaces. Our approach starts with a simple seed program, written in the language of the developer's choice, that implements the desired core functionality. It then systematically generates inputs and observes the resulting outputs to learn the core functionality. It finally automatically regenerates new code that implements the learned core functionality on the target computing platform. This regenerated code contains both (a) boilerplate code for the complex programming interfaces that the target computing platform presents and (b) systematic error and vulnerability checking code that makes the new implementations robust and secure. By providing a productive new mechanism for capturing and encapsulating knowledge about how to use modern complex interfaces, this new approach promises to greatly reduce the developer effort required to obtain secure, robust so ware that executes on modern computing platforms.",22 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2017-006,,Inference and Regeneration of Programs that Store and Retrieve Data,2017-04-24T19:45:07Z,,,,,,,,,

Many tensors are sparse, containing more than 90% zero entries. Efficient algorithms can leverage sparsity to do less work, but the irregular locations of the nonzero entries pose challenges to performance engineers. Many tensor operations such as tensor-vector multiplications can be sped up substantially by breaking the tensor into equally sized blocks (only storing blocks which contain nonzeros) and performing operations in each block using carefully tuned code. However, selecting the best block size is computationally challenging. Previously, Vuduc et al. defined the fill of a sparse tensor to be the number of stored entries in the blocked format divided by the number of nonzero entries, and showed that the fill can be used as an effective heuristic to choose a good block size. However, they gave no accuracy bounds for their method for estimating the fill, and it is vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this paper, we present a sampling-based method for finding a (1 + epsilon)-approximation to the fill of an order N tensor for all block sizes less than B, with probability at least 1 - delta, using O(B^(2N) log(B^N / delta) / epsilon^2) samples for each block size. We introduce an efficient routine to sample for all B^N block sizes at once in O(N B^N) time. We extend our concentration bounds to a more efficient bound based on sampling without replacement, using the recent Hoeffding-Serfling inequality. We then implement our algorithm and compare our scheme to that of Vuduc, as implemented in the Optimized Sparse Kernel Interface (OSKI) library. We find that our algorithm provides faster estimates of the fill at all accuracy levels, providing evidence that this is both a theoretical and practical improvement.

To determine whether we can construct a schedule for a given network, we typically consider one of two types of controllability: dynamic or strong. These controllability checks have strict conditions on how uncertainty is resolved; uncertain outcomes are either recognized immediately or not at all. In this paper, we introduce delay controllability, a novel generalization of both strong and dynamic controllability that additionally exposes a large range of controllability classes in between. To do so, we use a delay function to parameterize our controllability checking. This delay function represents the difference between when an event happens and the time that it is observed. We also provide a single unified algorithm for checking delay controllability that runs in O(n^3) time, matching the best known runtime for dynamic controllability, which we use to motivate the decision to generalize dynamic and strong controllability.

This robustness can be achieved through systems that are self-repairing. Underlying this is the ability to diagnose subtle failures. Likewise, online planners can generate novel responses to exceptional situations. These planners require an accurate estimate of state. Estimation methods based on hybrid discrete/continuous state models have emerged as a method of computing precise state estimates, which can be employed for either diagnosis or planning in hybrid domains. However, existing methods have difficulty scaling to systems with more than a handful of components. Discrete state estimation capabilities can scale to this level by combining best-first enumeration and conflict-directed search. Best-first methods have been developed for hybrid estimation, but the creation of conflict-directed methods has previously been elusive. While conflicts are used to learn from constraint violation, probabilistic hybrid estimation is relatively unconstrained. In this paper we present an approach to hybrid estimation that unifies best-first enumeration and conflict-directed search through the concept of ""bounding"" conflicts, an extension of conflicts that represent tighter bounds on the cost of regions of the search space.
