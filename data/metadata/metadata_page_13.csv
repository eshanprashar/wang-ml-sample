We give new protocols for several scenarios, whose provable performance guarantees are within a constant factor of optimal.

First, we give an improved version of consistent hashing, a scheme used for item to node assignments in the Chord system. In its original form, it required every network node to operate O(log n) virtual nodes to achieve a balanced load, causing a corresponding increase in space and bandwidth usage. Our protocol eliminates the necessity of virtual nodes while maintaining a balanced load. Improving on related protocols, our scheme allows for the deletion of nodes and admits a simpler analysis, since the assignments do not depend on the history of the network.

We then analyze a simple protocol for load sharing by movements of data from higher loaded to lower loaded nodes. This protocol can be extended to preserve the ordering of data items. As an application, we use the last protocol to give an efficient implementation of a distributed data structure for range searches on ordered data.",5 p.; 8268446 bytes; 349665 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,,New Algorithms for Load Balancing in Peer-to-Peer Systems,Theory of Computation

The experimental context ofthe research is dynamic detection of likely program invariants,but the ideas are applicable to other domains.Trying every possible predicate for conditional propertiesis computationally infeasible and yields too many undesirableproperties. This paper compares four policies forselecting predicates: procedure return analysis, code conditionals,clustering, and random selection. It also showshow to improve predicates via iterated analysis.

This proves (and generalizes) a conjecture of Rothand Peranson [23]. As a corollary of this result, we show that, withhigh probability, the truthful strategy is the best response for a givenplayer when the other players are truthful. We also analyze equilibriaof the deferred acceptance stable marriage game. We show thatthe game with complete information has an equilibrium in which a(1?o(1)) fraction of the strategies are truthful in expectation. In themore realistic setting of a game of incomplete information, we willshow that the set of truthful strategies form a (1+o(1))-approximateBayesian-Nash equilibrium.
