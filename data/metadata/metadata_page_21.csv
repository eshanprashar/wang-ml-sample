However, for many visual tasks, the more appropriate criterion of representational efficacy is Â‘recognitionÂ’, rather than Â‘reconstructionÂ’. It is unclear whether simple local features provide the stability necessary to subserve robust recognition of complex objects. In this paper, we search the space of two-lobed differential operators for those that constitute a good representational code under recognition/discrimination criteria. We find that a novel operator, which we call the Â‘dissociated dipoleÂ’ displays useful properties in this regard.

Our first result shows that with adaptive sampling in t rounds and O(k/eps) samples in each round, the additive error drops exponentially as eps^t; the computation time is nearly linear in the number of nonzero entries.
