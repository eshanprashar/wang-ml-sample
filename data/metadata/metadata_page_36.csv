Whenever a user's personal device observes an unrecognized signature, a GUI solicits the user's location. The resulting location-tagged signature or ""bind"" is then shared with other clients through a common database, enabling devices subsequently arriving there to discover location with no further user contribution.

Our algorithm assumes the availability of a reliable GPS service, which supplies mobile nodes with accurate information about real time and about their own geographical locations. The GPS service provides an external, shared source of consistency for mobile nodes, allowing them to label and timestamp messages, and thereby aiding in recovery from failures. Our algorithm utilizes a Virtual Infrastructure programming abstraction layer, consisting of mobile client nodes, virtual stationary timed machines called Virtual Stationary Automata (VSAs), and a local broadcast service connecting VSAs and mobile clients. VSAs are associated with predetermined regions in the plane, and are emulated in a self-stabilizing manner by the mobile nodes. VSAs are relatively stable in the face of node mobility and failure, and can be used to simplify algorithm development for mobile networks. Our routing algorithm consists of three subalgorithms: [(1)] a VSA-to-VSA geographical routing algorithm, [2] a mobile client location management algorithm, and [3] the main algorithm, which utilizes both location management and geographical routing.

This separation of concerns often leads to more effective and maintainable tools. The increasing efficiency of off-the-shelf constraint solvers makes this approach even more compelling. However, there are few, if any, effective and sufficiently expressive off-the-shelf solvers for string constraints generated by analysis techniques for string-manipulating programs. We designed and implemented Hampi, a solver for string constraints over bounded string variables. Hampi constraints express membership in regular languages and bounded context-free languages. Hampi constraints may contain context-free-language definitions, regular-language definitions and operations, and the membership predicate. Given a set of constraints, Hampi outputs a string that satisfies all the constraints, or reports that the constraints are unsatisfiable. Hampi is expressive and efficient, and can be successfully applied to testing and analysis of real programs. Our experiments use Hampi in: static and dynamic analyses for finding SQL injection vulnerabilities in Web applications; automated bug finding in C programs using systematic testing; and compare Hampi with another string solver.

Current wireless transmission schemes, however, cannot support smooth degradation. Specifically, each packet is transmitted at a particular bitrate and is decodable only by receivers that support the chosen bitrate. Broadcasting a video stream to all receivers requires transmitting at the lowest bitrate, and hence reduces everyone to the performance of the worst receiver in the multicast group.This paper introduces SoftCast, an alternative design for wireless video multicast, in which a sender broadcasts a single stream and each receiver watches a video quality that matches its channel quality. SoftCast achieves this by making the magnitude of the transmitted signal proportional to the pixel value. Hence, channel noise directly translates to a small perturbation in pixel values, allowing graceful degradation with increasing noise. SoftCast introduces a novel power allocation scheme that allows the transmission of real-valued video signals in a compact and resilient manner. We implement SoftCast in the WARP radio platform. Our results show that SoftCast improves the average video quality across multicast receivers by 3-7dB over the current approach. Further, it stays competitive with the current approach even for regular unicast.",14 p.,,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2009-005,,Wireless networks; Multicast; Wireless video; Video coding,SoftCast: One Video to Serve All Wireless Receivers,,,,,,,,

This paper shows how to overcome this limit. It presents a new design where multiple client-AP pairs can communicate concurrently, on the same 802.11 channel. We demonstrate both analytically and experimentally that our design almost doubles the throughput of a MIMO LAN.  The key idea underlying our approach is Interference Alignment and Cancellation (IAC), a novel technique for decoding concurrent sender-receiver pairs in MIMO LANs. It exploits two basic properties of MIMO LANs. First, MIMO transmitters can control the alignment of their signals at a receiver. Second, APs are typically connected to a backend Ethernet, which they can use for coordination. Hence, in IAC, transmitters align their signals such that the first AP can decode at least one of the concurrent packets. Once a packet is decoded, it is sent over the Ethernet to the second AP, which subtracts it from its received signal to decode a second packet, which it sends to the third AP to decode the next packet, and so on. We implement our technique in 2x2 MIMO GNU Radios, and demonstrate via wireless experiments that IAC increases the average throughput of a MIMO LAN by 1.5x on the downlink and 2x on the uplink.",15 p.,,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2009-007,,Interference alignment; Interference cancellation; Wireless networks,Overcoming the Antennas-Per-Node Throughput Limit in MIMO LANs,,,,,,,,

Concrete implementations of the Abstract MAC Layer over basic radio network models generate concrete definitions for these delay functions, automatically adapting bounds proven for the abstract service to bounds for the specific radio network under consideration. To illustrate this approach, we use the Abstract MAC Layer to study the new problem of Multi-Message Broadcast, a generalization of standard single-message broadcast, in which any number of messages arrive at any processes at any times.We present and analyze two algorithms for Multi-Message Broadcast in static networks: a simple greedy algorithm and one that uses regional leaders.

Past work on network coordinates has assumed that all nodes in the system behave correctly. The techniques in these systems do not behave well when nodes are Byzantine. These Byzantine failures, wherein a faulty node can behave arbitrarily, can make the coordinate-based distance estimates meaningless. For example, a Byzantine node can delay responding to some other node, thus distorting that node's computation of its own location. We present a network coordinate system based on landmarks, reference nodes that are used for measurements, some of which may be Byzantine faulty. It scales linearly in the number of clients computing their coordinates and does not require excessive network traffic to allow clients to do so.

These optimal plans are particularly susceptible to risk when uncertainty is introduced. We present a distributed planning algorithm that minimizes the system cost while ensuring that the probability of violating mission constraints is below a user-specified level. We build upon the paradigm of risk allocation (Ono and Williams, AAAI-08), in which the planner optimizes not only the sequence of actions, but also its allocation of risk among each constraint at each time step. We extend the concept of risk allocation to multi-agent systems by highlighting risk as a good that is traded in a computational market. The equilibrium price of risk that balances the supply and demand is found by an iterative price adjustment process called tatonnement (also known as Walrasian auction).

This paradigm combines usability and efficiency through the exploitation of a simple hardware mechanism, the remote store, which can easily be added to existing multicores.Remote store programs are marked by fine-grained and one-sided communication which results in a stream of data flowing from the registers of a sending process to the cache of a destination process. The RSP model and its hardware implementation trade a relatively high store latency for a low load latency because loads are more common than stores, and it is easier to tolerate store latency than load latency. This paper demonstrates the performance advantages of remote store programming by comparing it to both cache-coherent shared memory and direct memory access (DMA) based approaches using the TILEPro64 processor. The paper studies two applications: a two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (2D FFT) and an H.264 encoder for high-definition video. For a 2D FFT using 56 cores, RSP is 1.64x faster than DMA and 4.4x faster than shared memory. For an H.264 encoder using 40 cores, RSP achieves the same performance as DMA and 4.8x the performance of shared memory. Along with these performance advantages, RSP requires the least hardware support of the three.
