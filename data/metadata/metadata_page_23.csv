There are many types of applications that may make useof the AVMN infrastructure: tracking, supporting mobile users, or searching for energy sources.The AVMN extends the focal point abstraction in [9] and the virtual mobile node abstraction in [10].The new abstraction is that of a virtual general-purpose computing entity, an automaton that can makeautonomous on-line decisions concerning its own movement.

In addition, sets withcardinality constraints provide a natural language for specifyingoperations and invariants of data structures.Motivated by these program analysis applications, thispaper presents new algorithms and new complexity results forconstraints on sets and their cardinalities.
