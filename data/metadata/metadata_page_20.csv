For many traffic loads they provide far less total throughput than they should, and do a poor job allocating what throughput they do deliver. Inappropriate association of nodes to access points and rates to flows plays a large role in these problems. We address a major root cause of this problem in this paper.Current practice ignores the distinction between flows that connect two wireless nodes via an access point and flows that connect wireless nodes to the wired infrastructure. As wireless devices and applications become more pervasive, ignoring this distinction will lead to a significant degradation in perceived performance.In this paper, we i) describe a series of examples that illustrates the impact of two-hop flows on the performance of the system, ii) provide a practical algorithm to solve the AP-assignment problem and iii) evaluate the performance of our algorithm against other approaches. Our preliminary results show that our algorithm can increase average achieved throughput by as much as 50% for some traffic loads.",17 p.; 20308180 bytes; 807306 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Capacity Allocation in Wireless LANs,,,,

The Â“standard modelÂ” of object recognition, a recently developed model [23] to account for recognition properties of IT cells (extending classical suggestions by Hubel, Wiesel and others [9, 10, 19]), is used here to model the response of the V4 cells described in [18]. Our results show that a feedforward, network level mechanism can exhibit selectivity and invariance properties that correspond to the responses of the V4 cells described in [18]. These results suggest howobject-centered, position-specific curvature tuning of V4 cells may arise from combinations of complex V1 cell responses. Furthermore, the model makes predictions about the responses of the same V4 cells studied by Pasupathy and Connor to novel gray level patterns, such as gratings and natural images.

In the information flow formulation, a vertex can transmit a function of the information it received thereby allowing multiple source-sink pairs to share bandwidth. For directed acyclic graphs with n vertices, we show that the rate achievable in the information flow formulation can be a multiplicative factor n larger than the rate achievable in the multicommodity flow formulation. It is well known [5] that for undirected graphs with n vertices, in the multicommodity flow formulation, the maximum rate achievable can be an O(1/log|V|) multiplicative factor smaller than the value of the sparsest cut. We extend this result to show that the maximum rate achievable in the information flow setting can be an O(1/log|V|) multiplicative factor smaller than the sparsest cut value.For directed acyclic graphs G, we define a parameter called the value of the most meager cut which is an upper bound for the maximum rate achievable in the information flow setting.We also present an example illustrating that this upper bound is not always tight.",13 p.; 14089646 bytes; 597139 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Comparing Network Coding with Multicommodity Flow for the k-pairs Communication Problem,,,,

Programs implement such data structures using references todynamically allocated objects, which allows data structures to store unboundednumbers of objects, but makes reasoning about programs more difficult. Reasoningabout object-oriented programs with complex data structures is simplified if datastructure operations are specified in terms of abstract sets of objects associatedwith each data structure. For example, an insertion into a data structure in thisapproach becomes simply an insertion into a dynamically changing set-valued fieldof an object, as opposed to a manipulation of a dynamically linked structure linkedto the object.In this paper we explore reasoning techniques for programs that manipulate datastructures specified using set-valued abstract fields associated with container objects.We compare the expressive power and the complexity of specification languagesbased on 1) decidable prefix vocabulary classes of first-order logic, 2) twovariablelogic with counting, and 3) Nelson-Oppen combinations of multisortedtheories. Such specification logics can be used for verification of object-orientedprograms with supplied invariants.

The patterns indicatearticulator configuration trajectories (how the tongue, jaws, etc. aremoving), which are interpreted as syllables and words.My patterns are an alternative to frequency.
