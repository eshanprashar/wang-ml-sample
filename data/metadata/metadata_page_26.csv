Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences -- generally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for largeset sizes.  We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space.

Imagine two players, Alice and Bob, who want toexchange information.  Collin, a malicious adversary, wants to preventthem from communicating.  By broadcasting at the same time as Alice orBob, Collin can destroy their messages or overwhelm them with his ownmalicious data.  Being a tiny device, however, Collin can onlybroadcast up to B times. Given that Alice and Bob do not knowB, and cannot distinguish honest from malicious messages, howlong can Collin prevent them from communicating?  We show the answerto be 2B + Theta(lg|V|) communication rounds, where V is theset of values that Alice and Bob may transmit.

This model is consistent with a general theory of visual processing that extends the hierarchical model of (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959) from primary to extrastriate visual areas. It attempts to explain the first few hundred milliseconds of visual processing and Â“immediate recognitionÂ”. One of the key elements in the approach is the learning of a generic dictionary of shape-components from V2 to IT, which provides an invariant representation to task-specific categorization circuits in higher brain areas. This vocabulary of shape-tuned units is learned in an unsupervised manner from natural images, and constitutes a large and redundant set of image features with different complexities and invariances.  This theory significantly extends an earlier approach by (Riesenhuber & Poggio, 1999) and builds upon several existing neurobiological models and conceptual proposals.First, I present evidence to show that the model can duplicate the tuning properties of neurons in various brain areas (e.g., V1, V4 and IT). In particular, the model agrees with data from V4 about the response of neurons to combinations of simple two-bar stimuli (Reynolds et al, 1999) (within the receptive field of the S2 units) and some of the C2 units in the model show a tuning for boundary conformations which is consistent with recordings from V4 (Pasupathy & Connor, 2001). Second, I show that not only can the model duplicate the tuning properties of neurons in various brain areas when probed with artificial stimuli, but it can also handle the recognition of objects in the real-world, to the extent of competing with the best computer vision systems. Third, I describe a comparison between the performance of the model and the performance of human observers in a rapid animal vs. non-animal recognition task for which recognition is fast and cortical back-projections are likely to be inactive.  Results indicate that the model predicts human performance extremely well when the delay between the stimulus and the mask is about 50 ms.  This suggests that cortical back-projections may not play a significant role when the time interval is in this range, and the model may therefore provide a satisfactory description of the feedforward path.Taken together, the evidences suggest that we may have the skeleton of a successful theory of visual cortex.  In addition, this may be the first time that a neurobiological model, faithful to the physiology and the anatomy of visual cortex, not only competes with some of the best computer vision systems thus providing a realistic alternative to engineered artificial vision systems, but also achieves performance close to that of humans in a categorization task involving complex natural images.",211 p.; 75497472 bytes; 6889446 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,"Learning a Dictionary of Shape-Components in Visual Cortex: Comparison with Neurons, Humans and Machines",,,"object recognition, model, machine vision, neuroscience, visual system, feedforward, biologically inspired, hierarchy",PhD thesis,

In the space domain, execution of temporally flexible plans has provided an enabler for achieving the desired coordination and robustness, in the context of space probes and planetary rovers, modeled as discrete systems. We address the challenge of extending plan execution to systems with continuous dynamics, such as air vehicles and robot manipulators, and that are controlled indirectly through the setting of continuous state variables.Systems with continuous dynamics are more challenging than discrete systems, because they require continuous, low-level control, and cannot be controlled by issuing simple sequences of discrete commands. Hence, manually controlling these systems (or plants) at a low level can become very costly, in terms of the number of human operators necessary to operate the plant. For example, in the case of a fleet of UAVs performing a search-and-rescue scenario, the traditional approach to controlling the UAVs involves providing series of close waypoints for each aircraft, which incurs a high workload for the human operators, when the fleet consists of a large number of vehicles.Our solution is a novel, model-based executive, called Sulu, that takes as input a qualitative state plan, specifying the desired evolution of the state of the system. This approach elevates the interaction between the human operator and the plant, to a more abstract level where the operator is able to Â“coachÂ” the plant by qualitatively specifying the tasks, or activities, the plant must perform. These activities are described in a qualitative manner, because they specify regions in the plantÂ’s state space in which the plant must be at a certain point in time. Time constraints are also described qualitatively, in the form of flexible temporal constraints between activities in the state plan. The design of low-level control inputs in order to meet this abstract goal specification is then delegated to the autonomous controller, hence decreasing the workload per human operator. This approach also provides robustness to the executive, by giving it room to adapt to disturbances and unforeseen events, while satisfying the qualitative constraints on the plant state, specified in the qualitative state plan.Sulu reasons on a model of the plant in order to dynamically generate near-optimal control sequences to fulfill the qualitative state plan. To achieve optimality and safety, Sulu plans into the future, framing the problem as a disjunctive linear programming problem. To achieve robustness to disturbances and maintain tractability, planning is folded within a receding horizon, continuous planning and execution framework. The key to performance is a problem reduction method based on constraint pruning.

In order to act robustly in the physical world, robotic systems must be able to detect changes in operational mode, such as faults, whose symptoms manifest themselves only in the continuous state. In such systems, the state is observed indirectly, and must therefore be estimated in a robust, memory-efficient manner from noisy observations.Probabilistic hybrid discrete/continuous models, such as Concurrent Probabilistic Hybrid Automata (CPHA) are convenient modeling tools for such systems. In CPHA, the hidden state is represented with discrete and continuous state variables that evolve probabilistically. In this paper, we present a novel method for estimating the hybrid state of CPHA that achieves robustness by balancing greedy and stochastic search. The key insight is that stochastic and greedy search methods, taken together, are often particularly effective in practice.To accomplish this, we first develop an efficient stochastic sampling approach for CPHA based on Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filtering. We then propose a strategy for mixing stochastic and greedy search. The resulting method is able to handle three particularly challenging aspects of real-world systems, namely that they 1) exhibit autonomous mode transitions, 2) consist of a large collection of concurrently operating components, and 3) are non-linear. Autonomous mode transitions, that is, discrete transitions that depend on thecontinuous state, are particularly challenging to address, since they couple the discrete and continuous state evolution tightly. In this paper we extend the class of autonomous mode transitions that can be handled to arbitrary piecewise polynomial transition distributions.We perform an empirical comparison of the greedy and stochastic approaches to hybrid estimation, and then demonstrate the robustness of the mixed method incorporated with our HME (Hybrid Mode Estimation) capability.

A challenging example of such a robot is a bipedal walking machine.  Such a robot should be able to walk to a particular location within a particular time, while observing foot placement constraints, and avoiding a fall, if this is physically possible.  Although stable walking machines have been built, the problem of task-level control, where the tasks have stringent state-space and temporal requirements, and where significant disturbances may occur, has not been studied extensively.  This thesis addresses this problem through three objectives.  The first is to devise a plan specification where task requirements are expressed in a qualitative form that provides for execution flexibility.  The second is to develop a task-level executive that accepts such a plan, and outputs a sequence of control actions that result in successful plan execution.  The third is to provide this executive with disturbance handling ability.Development of such an executive is challenging because the biped is highly nonlinear and has limited actuation due to its limited base of support.  We address these challenges with three key innovations.  To address the nonlinearity, we develop a dynamic virtual model controller to linearize the biped, and thus, provide an abstracted biped that is easier to control.  The controller is model-based, but uses a sliding control technique to compensate for model inaccuracy.  To address the under-actuation, our system generates flow tubes, which define valid operating regions in the abstracted biped.  The flow tubes represent sets of state trajectories that take into account dynamic limitations due to under-actuation, and also satisfy plan requirements.  The executive keeps trajectories in the flow tubes by adjusting a small number of control parameters for key state variables in the abstracted biped, such as center of mass.  Additionally, our system uses a novel strategy that employs angular momentum to enhance translational controllability of the systemÂ’s center of mass.  We evaluate our approach using a high-fidelity biped simulation.

This uncertainty arises due to uncertain state estimation, disturbances and modeling errors. Previous solutions to the robust path planning problem solved this problem using a finite horizon optimal stochastic control approach. This approach finds the optimal path subject to chance constraints, which ensure that the probability of collision with obstacles is below a given threshold. This approach is limited to problems where all uncertain distributions are Gaussian, and typically result in highly conservative plans. In many cases, however, the Gaussian assumption is invalid; for example in the case of localization, the belief state about a vehicleÂ’s position can consist of highly non-Gaussian, even multimodal, distributions.In this paper we present a novel method for finite horizon stochastic control ofdynamic systems subject to chance constraints. The method approximates the distribution of the system state using a finite number of particles. By expressing these particles in terms of the control variables, we are able to approximate the original stochastic control problem as a deterministic one; furthermore the approximation becomes exact as the number of particles tends to infinity. For a general class of chance constrained problems with linear system dynamics, we show that the approximate problem can be solved using efficient Mixed-Integer Linear Programming techniques.

The goal is to be able to take an unspecified number of simple robots and a supply of building material, give the system a high-level specification for any arbitrary structure desired, and have a guarantee that it will produce that structure without further intervention.In this thesis I describe such a distributed system for automating construction, in which autonomous mobile robots collectively build user-specified structures from square building blocks.  The approach preserves many desirable features of the natural systems, such as considerable parallelism and robustness to factorslike robot loss and variable order or timing of actions.  Further, unlike insect colonies, it can build particular desired structures according to a high-level design provided by the user.Robots in this system act without explicit communication or cooperation, instead using the partially completed structure to coordinate their actions.  This mechanism is analogous to that of stigmergy used by social insects, in which insects take actions that affect the environment, and the environmental state influences further actions.  I introduce a framework of ""extended stigmergy"" in which building blocks are allowed to store, process or communicate information.  Increasing the capabilities of the building material (rather than of the robots) in this way increases the availability of nonlocal structure information.  Benefits include significant improvements in construction speed and in ability to take advantage of the parallelism of the swarm.This dissertation describes system design and control rules for decentralized teams of robots that provably build arbitrary solid structures in two dimensions.  I present a hardware prototype, and discuss extensions to more general structures, including those built with multiple block types and in three dimensions.",116 p.; 3106746 bytes; 130023424 bytes,application/pdf; application/postscript,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Anthills Built to Order: Automating Construction with Artificial Swarms,,,,PhD thesis,"Ph.D. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"

This paper defines an operational semantics for an essential subset of the Subtext language. It also presents a fresh approach to the problems of mutable state, I/O, and concurrency.Inclusions reify copy & paste edits into persistent relationships that propagate changes from their source into their destination. Inclusions formulate a programming language in which there is no distinction between a programÂ’s representation and its execution. Like spreadsheets, programs are live executions within a persistent runtime, and programming is direct manipulation of these executions via a graphical user interface. There is no need to encode programs into source text.Mutation of state is effected by the computation of hypothetical recursive variants of the state, which can then be lifted into new versions of the state. Transactional concurrency is based upon queued single-threaded execution. Speculative execution of queued hypotheticals provides concurrency as a semantically transparent implementation optimization.",20 p.; 610092 bytes; 11137489 bytes,application/pdf; application/postscript,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,First Class Copy & Paste,,,prototypes; copy and paste; modularity; reactivity; transactions,,
