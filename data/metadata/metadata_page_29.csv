Secure platforms have been proposed that protect the secrecy of application algorithms and enforce copy protection assurances. Unfortunately, these capabilities incur a sizeable performance overhead. Partitioning an application into secure and insecure regions can help diminish these overheads but invalidates guarantees of code secrecy and copy protection.This work examines one of the problems of partitioning an application into public and private regions, the ability of an adversary to recreate those private regions. To our knowledge, it is the first to analyze this problem when considering application operation as a whole. Looking at the fundamentals of the issue, we analyze one of the simplest attacks possible, a ``Memoization Attack.'' We implement an efficient Memoization Attack and discuss necessary techniques that limit storage and computation consumption. Experimentation reveals that certain classes of real-world applications are vulnerable to Memoization Attacks. To protect against such an attack, we propose a set of indicator tests that enable an application designer to identify susceptible application code regions.",11 p.; 436268 bytes; 1481611 bytes,application/pdf; application/postscript,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Security; Architecture; Trusted Execution; Security Analysis; Digital Rights Management,Memoization Attacks and Copy Protection in Partitioned Applications,,,,,,,,

Concerning this notion, which we call bounded-CCA2 security, we show the following two results.  (1) Bounded-CCA2 secure non-malleable encryption schemes exist if and only if semantically-secure (IND-CPA-secure) encryption schemes exist.(As far as we know, bounded-CCA2 non-malleability is the strongest notion of security known to be satisfiable assuming only the existence of semantically-secure encryption schemes.)  (2) In contrast to CCA2 security, bounded-CCA2 security alone does not imply non-malleability.

Vector-thread architectures unify data-level, thread-level, and instruction-level parallelism, providing new ways of parallelizing codes that are difficult to vectorize or that incur excessive synchronization costs when multithreaded. To illustrate these ideas we have developed the Scale processor, which is an example of a vector-thread architecture designed for low-power and high-performance embedded systems. The prototype includes a single-issue 32-bit RISC control processor, a vector-thread unit which supports up to 128 virtual processor threads and can execute up to 16 instructions per cycle, and a 32 KB shared primary cache.Since the Scale Vector-Thread Processor is a large and complex design (especially for an academic project), we first designed and fabricated the Scale Test Chip (STC1). STC1 includes a simplified version of the Scale control processor, 8 KB of RAM, a host interface, and a custom clock generator.  STC1 helped mitigate the risk involved in fabricating the full Scale chip in several ways. First, we were able to establish and test our CAD toolflow. Our toolflow included several custom tools which had not previously been used in any tapeouts. Second, we were able to better characterize our target package and process. For example, STC1 enabled us to better correlate the static timing numbers from our CAD tools with actual silicon and also to characterize the expected rise/fall times of our external signal pins. Finally, STC1 allowed us to test our custom clock generator. We used our experiences with STC1 to help us implement the Scale vector-thread processor.

The current opportunistic routing protocol, ExOR, ties the MAC with routing, imposing a strict schedule on routers' access to the medium. Although the scheduler delivers opportunistic gains, it misses some of the inherent features of the 802.11 MAC. For example, it prevents spatial reuse and thus may underutilize the wireless medium.  It also eliminates the layering abstraction, making the protocol less amenable to extensions of alternate traffic type such as multicast.This paper presents MORE, a MAC-independent opportunistic routing protocol. MORE randomly mixes packets before forwarding them. This randomness ensures that routers that hear the same transmission do not forward the same packets. Thus, MORE needs no special scheduler to coordinate routers and can run directly on top of 802.11. Experimental results from a 20-node wireless testbed show that MORE's average unicast throughput is 20% higher than ExOR, and the gains rise to 50% over ExOR when there is a chance of spatial reuse.
