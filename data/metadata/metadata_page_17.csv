In our approach, leases are implemented from the very shared data that they protect. That is, there is no global lease manager, there is a lease per data item (e.g., a file, a directory, a disk partition, etc.) or a collection thereof. Our lease primitives are useful for facillitating exculsive access to data in systems satisfying certain timeliness constraints. In addition, they can be utilized as a building block for implementing dependable services resilient to timing failures. In particular, we show a simple lease based solution for fault-tolerant Consensus which is a benchmark distributed coordination problem.",26 p.; 28838794 bytes; 1106660 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,,Light-Weight Leases for Storage-Centric Coordination,Theory of Computation

Routing fragility is largely due to the flexible and powerful ways in which BGP can be configured to perform various tasks, which range from implementing the policies of commercial relationships to configuring backup paths. Configuring routers in an AS is like writing a distributed program, and BGP's flexible configuration and today's relatively low-level configuration languages make the process error-prone. The primary method used by operators to determine whether their complex configurations are correct is to try them out in operation.We believe that there is a need for a systematic approach to verifying router configurations before they are deployed. This paper develops a static analysis framework for configuration checking, and uses it in the design of rcc, a ``router configuration checker''. rcc takes as input a set of router configurations and flags anomalies and errors, based on a set of well-defined correctness conditions. We have used rcc to check BGP configurations from 9 operational networks, testing nearly 700 real-world router configurations in the process. Every network we analyzed had configuration errors, some of which were potentially serious and had previously gone unnoticed. Our analysis framework and results also suggest ways in which BGP and configuration languages should be improved. rcc has also been downloaded by 30 network operators to date.",14 p.; 28764880 bytes; 1265172 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,,Verifying the Correctness of Wide-Area Internet Routing,Networks and Mobile Systems

Because our analysis extracts a precise representation of the region of the heap that each method may access, it is able to provide useful information even for methods with externally visible side effects. In particular, it can recognize read-only parameters (a parameter is read-only if the method does not mutate any objects transitively reachable from the parameter) and safe parameters (a parameter is safe if it is read-only and the method does not create any new externally visible paths in the heap to objects transitively reachable from the parameter). The analysis can also generate regular expressions that characterize the externally visible heap locations that the method mutates.We have implemented our analysis and used it to analyze several data structure implementations. Our results show that our analysis effectively recognize a variety of pure methods, including pure methods that allocate and mutate complex auxiliary data structures. Even if the methods are not pure, our analysis can provide information which may enable developers to usefully bound the potential side effects of the method.",16 p.; 28889089 bytes; 1207932 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,,A Combined Pointer and Purity Analysis for Java Programs,Computer Architecture

In this work, I contribute to these goals by proposing an architecture for a system that can learn commonsense knowledge about the properties and behavior of objects in the world.
