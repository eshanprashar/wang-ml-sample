We also introduce a hybrid o_ine-online checking scheme designed for untrusted storages in file systems and databases. Previous work [GSC+02] [FKM00] [MVS00] describe systems in which Merkle trees are used to verify the authenticity of data stored on untrusted storage. The Merkle trees [Mer79] are used to check, after each operation, whether the storage performed correctly. The offline and hybrid checkers are designed for checking sequences of operations on an untrusted storage and, in the common case, require only a constant overhead on the number of accesses to the storage, as compared to the logarithmic overhead incurred by online Merkle tree schemes",,,,

The input to our analysis is a Phased Computation Graph, which we define as a generalization of the most widely used dataflow representations, including synchronous dataflow, cyclo-static dataflow, and computation graphs. The output of our analysis is a System of Affine Recurrence Equations (SARE) that exactly captures the data dependencies between the nodes of the original graph. Using the SARE representation, one can apply many techniques from the scientific community that are new to the DSP domain. For example, we propose simple optimizations such as node splitting, decimation propagation, and stead-state invariant code motion that leverage the fine-grained dependence information of the SARE to perform novel transformations on a stream graph. We also propose ways in which the polyhedral model can offer new approaches to classic problems of the DSP community, such as minimizing buffer size, code size, and optimizing the schedule.",,,,

It has also turned  out to model successfully a number of other  properties of the ventral visual stream (the  visual pathway thought to be crucial for object  recognition in cortex), and particularly of (view-tuned) neurons in macaque inferotemporal  cortex, the brain area at the top of the ventral  stream. The original modeling study only  used ``paperclip'' stimuli, as in the  corresponding physiology experiment, and did  not explore systematically how model units'  invariance properties depended on model  parameters. In this study, we aimed at a  deeper understanding of the inner workings of  HMAX and its performance for various  parameter settings and ``natural'' stimulus  classes. We examined HMAX responses for  different stimulus sizes and positions  systematically and found a dependence of  model units' responses on stimulus position  for which a quantitative description is offered.  Interestingly, we find that scale invariance  properties of hierarchical neural models are  not independent of stimulus class, as  opposed to translation invariance, even  though both are affine transformations within  the image plane.",12 p.; 2137337 bytes; 1062341 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI

However, the detailed neural mechanisms  that underlie the recognition of such complex  movement patterns remain largely unknown.  This paper reviews the experimental results  and summarizes them in terms of a  biologically plausible neural model.

The mathematical  analysis of such models has been restricted  so far to the case of purely linear networks.  We present an exact analytical solution of the  nonlinear dynamics of a class of direction  selective recurrent neural models with  threshold nonlinearity. Our mathematical  analysis shows that such networks have  form-stable stimulus-locked traveling pulse  solutions that are appropriate for modeling  the responses of direction selective cortical  neurons. Our analysis shows also that the  stability of such solutions can break down  giving raise to a different class of solutions  (""lurching activity waves"") that are  characterized by a specific spatio-temporal  periodicity. These solutions cannot arise in  models for direction selectivity with purely  linear spatio-temporal filtering.",7 p.; 2554351 bytes; 1165357 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; direction; visual cortex; nonlinear dynamics; lurching waves; stability; recurre

Because of the dynamic nature of these networks, resource discovery is one of the fundamental problems that must be faced. While resource discovery systems are not a novel concept, securing these systems in an efficient and scalable way is challenging. This paper describes the design and implementation of an architecture for access-controlled resource discovery. This system achieves this goal by integrating access control with the Intentional Naming System (INS), a resource discovery and service location system. The integration is scalable, efficient, and fits well within a proxy-based security framework designed for dynamic networks. We provide performance experiments that show how our solution outperforms existing schemes. The result is a system that provides secure, access-controlled resource discovery that can scale to large numbers of resources and users",,,,

For example, we may wish to recover  regulatory networks from high-throughput data sources. In this paper  we examine how Bayesian regularization using a Dirichlet prior over the  model parameters affects the learned model structure in a  domain with discrete variables. Surprisingly, a weak prior in the  sense of smaller equivalent sample size leads to a strong  regularization of the model structure (sparse graph) given a sufficiently  large data set. In particular, the empty graph is obtained in the  limit of a vanishing strength of prior belief. This is  diametrically opposite to what one may expect in this limit, namely the  complete graph from an (unregularized) maximum likelihood estimate.  Since the prior affects the parameters as expected, the prior strength  balances a ""trade-off"" between regularizing the parameters or the  structure of the model. We demonstrate the benefits of optimizing this  trade-off in the sense of predictive accuracy.",11 p.; 3152389 bytes; 1414851 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; Regularization; Dirichlet Prior

Real-world scenes  (e.g., albedos or shapes) can be very complex, conventionally requiring  high dimensional representations which are hard to estimate  and store. We propose a low-dimensional representation, called a  scene recipe, that relies on the image itself to describe the  complex scene configurations. Shape recipes are an  example: these are the regression coefficients that predict the  bandpassed shape from bandpassed image data. We describe the  benefits of this representation, and show two uses  illustrating their properties: (1) we improve stereo shape estimates by  learning shape recipes at low resolution and applying them at full resolution;  (2) Shape recipes implicitly contain information about lighting  and materials and we use them for material segmentation.",12 p.; 2606902 bytes; 1497926 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; scene representation; shape; stereo; shape recipes

From a computational perspective, we  propose that the scientific-cognitive question of combining top-down and bottom-up knowledge is similar to the engineering  question of labeling a training set in a supervised learning problem.  We investigate these questions in the realm  of facial analysis. We propose the use of a linear morphable model  (LMM) for representing top-down structure and use it to model  various facial variations such as mouth shapes and expression, the pose of  faces and visual speech (visemes). We apply a supervised learning  method based on support vector machine (SVM) regression for  estimating the parameters of LMMs directly from pixel-based representations of  faces.
