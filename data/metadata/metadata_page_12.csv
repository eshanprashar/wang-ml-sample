In short, they violate the program's execution model. The execution model encompasses the Application Binary Interface (ABI), higher-level specifications from the program's source programming language, and components specific to the program --- for example, which values a particular function pointer may take.  If this execution model were enforced, and only program actions that the programmer intended were allowed, a majority of current security holes would be closed.   In this paper, we employ program shepherding[26] to enforce a program's execution model.  Program shepherding monitors control flow in order to enforce a security policy.  We use static and dynamic analyses to automatically build a custom security policy for a target program which specifies the program's execution model.  We have implemented our analyses in the DynamoRIO [5] runtime code modification system.  The resulting system imposes minimal or no performance overhead, operates on unmodified native binaries, and requires no special hardware or operating system support.  Our static analyses require source code access but not recompilation.  The analysis process requires no user interaction, but is able to build a strict enough policy to prevent all deviations from the program's control flow graph and nearly all violations of the calling convention, greatly reducing the possibility of an unintended program action.",MIT-LCS-TM-638,Execution Model Enforcement Via Program Shepherding,,,,,

The first tracking technique is a robust  implementation of stereo-based head tracking  designed for interactive environments with uncontrolled  lighting. We integrate fast face detection and drift  reduction algorithms with a gradient-based stereo rigid  motion tracking technique. Our system can  automatically segment and track a user's head under large rotation and illumination variations. Precision and  usability of this approach are compared with previous  tracking methods for cursor control and target selection  in both desktop and interactive room environments.  The second tracking technique is designed to improve  the robustness of head pose tracking for fast  movements. Our iterative hybrid tracker combines  constraints from the ICP (Iterative Closest Point)  algorithm and normal flow constraint. This new  technique is more precise for small movements and  noisy depth than ICP alone, and more robust for large  movements than the normal flow constraint alone. We present experiments which  test the accuracy of our approach on sequences of real  and synthetic stereo images.  The 3D model acquisition system we present quickly  aligns intensity and depth images, and reconstructs a  textured 3D mesh. 3D views are registered with shape  alignment based on our iterative hybrid tracker. We  reconstruct the 3D model using a new Cubic Ray  Projection merging algorithm which takes advantage of  a novel data structure: the linked voxel space.

Robotic execution languages such as RAPs, ESL, and TDL improve robustness by managing functionally redundant procedures for achieving goals. The model-based programming approach extends this by guaranteeing correctness of execution through pre-planning of non-deterministic timed threads of activities. Executing model-based programs effectively on distributed autonomous platforms requires distributing this pre-planning process. This thesis presents a distributed planner for modelbased programs whose planning and execution is distributed among agents with widely varying levels of processor power and memory resources. We make two key contributions. First, we reformulate a model-based program, which describes cooperative activities, into a hierarchical dynamic simple temporal network. This enables efficient distributed coordination of robots and supports deployment on heterogeneous robots. Second, we introduce a distributed temporal planner, called DTP, which solves hierarchical dynamic simple temporal networks with the assistance of the distributed Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm. The implementation of DTP has been demonstrated successfully on a wide range of randomly generated examples and on a pursuer-evader challenge problem in simulation.",AITR-2003-012,Safe Distributed Coordination of Heterogeneous Robots through Dynamic Simple Temporal Networks,AITR-2003-012,95 p.; 3611933 bytes; 908879 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; model-based autonomy; distributed planning; distributed constraint satisfaction

Our results apply to a broad family of graph problems, called bidimensional problems, which includes many domination and covering problems such as vertex cover, feedback vertex set, minimum maximal matching, dominating set, edge dominating set, clique-transversal set, and many others restricted to bounded genus graphs. Furthermore, it is fairly straightforward to prove that a problem is bidimensional.  In particular, our framework includes as special cases all previously known problems to have such subexponential algorithms.  Previously, these algorithms applied to planar graphs, single-crossing-minor-free graphs, and/or map graphs; we extend these results to apply to bounded-genus graphs as well.  In a parallel development of combinatorial results, we establish an upper bound on the treewidth (or branchwidth) of a bounded-genus graph that excludes some planar graph H as a minor.  This bound depends linearly on the size |V(H)| of the excluded graph H and the genus g(G) of the graph G, and applies and extends the graph-minors work of Robertson and Seymour.   Building on these results, we develop subexponential fixed-parameter algorithms for dominating set, vertex cover, and set cover in any class of graphs excluding a fixed graph H as a minor.  In particular, this general category of graphs includes planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, single-crossing-minor-free graphs, and any class of graphs that is closed under taking minors. Specifically, the running time is 2^O(sqrt k) n^h, where h is a constant depending only on H, which is polynomial for k = O(log^2 n).  We introduce a general approach for developing algorithms on H-minor-free graphs, based on structural results about H-minor-free graphs at the heart of Robertson and Seymour's graph-minors work.  We believe this approach opens the way to further development on problems in H-minor-free graphs.",MIT-LCS-TR-905,Subexponential Parameterized Algorithms on Graphs of Bounded Genus and H-minor-free Graphs,,,,,

It shows  that a robotic platform can build up and maintain a  system for object localization, segmentation, and  recognition, starting from very little. What the robot  starts with is a direct solution to achieving figure/ground  separation: it simply 'pokes around' in a region of visual  ambiguity and watches what happens. If the arm  passes through an area, that area is recognized as free  space. If the arm collides with an object, causing it to  move, the robot can use that motion to segment the  object from the background. Once the robot can  acquire reliable segmented views of objects, it learns  from them, and from then on recognizes and segments  those objects without further contact. Both low-level and  high-level visual features can also be learned in this  way, and examples are presented for both: orientation  detection and affordance recognition, respectively. The  motivation for this work is simple. Training on large  corpora of annotated real-world data has proven crucial  for creating robust solutions to perceptual problems  such as speech recognition and face detection. But the  powerful tools used during training of such systems are  typically stripped away at deployment. Ideally they  should remain, particularly for unstable tasks such as  object detection, where the set of objects needed in a  task tomorrow might be different from the set of objects  needed today. The key limiting factor is access to  training data, but as this thesis shows, that need not be  a problem on a robotic platform that can actively probe  its environment, and carry out experiments to resolve  ambiguity.

Previous theoretical work on market-making has  led to price-setting equations for which solutions cannot be  achieved in practice, whereas empirical work on algorithms for  market-making has focused on sets of heuristics and rules that lack  theoretical justification.

Using  many, sharply tuned units, an ``expert'' has a large inversion effect. On the other hand, if fewer, broadly  tuned units are used, the expertise is lost, and this ``novice'' has a small inversion effect. As the size of the inversion effect  is a product of the representation, not the object class, given the right  training we can create experts and novices in any object class. Using the same representations as with  faces, we create experts and novices for cars. We also measure the  feasibility of a view-based model for recognition of rotated objects  using HMAX. Using faces, we show that transfer of learning to novel views is possible.  Given only one training view, the view-based model  can recognize a face at a new orientation via interpolation from the views to  which it had been tuned.

However, most projects invariably concentrate on developing a few of these individual components, neglecting the issue of how all of these pieces would eventually fit together.

Third, it develops a framework for a system which enables a robot to learn new behaviors via interacting with itself and the outside world.
