This will bring many benefits to Java programmers, not least because current Java practise makes heavy use of pseudo-generic classes.  Such classes (for example, those in package java.util) have logically generic specifications and documentation, but the type system cannot prove their patterns of use to be safe.   This work aims to solve the problem of automatic translation of Java source code into Generic Java (GJ) source code.  We present two algorithms that together can be used to translate automatically a Java source program into a semantically-equivalent GJ program with generic types.   The first algorithm infers a candidate generalisation for any class, based on the methods of that class in isolation.  The second algorithm analyses the whole program; it determines a precise parametric type for every value in the program.  Optionally, it also refines the generalisations produced by the first analysis as required by the patterns of use of those classes in client code.",MIT-LCS-TR-889,Inference of Generic Types in Java,,,,,,

Finally, it weaves the MDG for each piece of advice into the partial SDG for those methods whose behavior may be affected by the advice. The result is the complete SDG. Our SDGs capture the additional structure present in many aspect-oriented features such as join points, advice, introduction, aspects, and aspect inheritance, and various types of interactions between aspects and classes. They also correctly reflect the semantics of aspect-oriented concepts such as advice precedence, introduction scope, and aspect weaving. SDGs therefore provide a solid foundation for the further analysis of aspect-oriented programs.",MIT-LCS-TR-891,System Dependence Graph Construction for Aspect-Oriented Programs,,,,,,

This dencentralized structure allows L* to maintain meta-data consistency without locking and to isolate users' changes from each other, an appropriate arrangement for unreliable users. Applications use L* to maintain consistent data structures. L* interleaves multiple logs deterministically so that decentralized clients can agree on the order of completed operations, even if those operations where issued concurrently. When the data structure is quiescent, L* guarantees that clients agree on the state of the data structure. L* optionally provides mutual exclusion for applications that need to ensure atomicity for multi-step operations. The Ivy file system, built on top of L*, demonstrates that L*'s consistency guarantees are useful and can be used and implemented efficiently.",MIT-LCS-TR-888,Building Data Structures on Untrusted Peer-to-Peer Storage with Per-participant Logs,,,,,,

This paper proposes stream algorithms, which, along with a decoupled systolic architecture, provide an excellent match for the physical and technological constraints of single-chip tiles architectures. Stream algorithms enable programmed systolic computations for different problem sizes, without incurring the cost of memory accesses. To that end, we decouple memory accesses from computation and move the memory accesses off the critical path. By structuring computations in systolic phases, and deferring memory accesses to dedicated memory processors, stream algorithms can solve many regular problems with varying sizes on a constant-sized tiled array. Contrary to common sense, the compute efficiency of stream algorithms increases as we increase the number of processing elements. In particular, we show that the compute efficiency of stream algorithms can approach 100% asymptotically, that is for large numbers of processors and appropriate problem size.",MIT-LCS-TM-636,Stream Algorithms and Architecture,,,,,,

Past  studies that have investigated this issue have typically  used high-resolution images or good-quality line  drawings as facial stimuli. The results obtained are  therefore most relevant for understanding the  identification of faces at close range. However, given  that real-world viewing conditions are rarely optimal, it  is also important to know how image degradations,  such as loss of resolution caused by large viewing  distances, influence our ability to use internal and  external features. Here, we report experiments  designed to address this issue. Our data characterize  how the relative contributions of internal and external  features change as a function of image resolution.  While we replicated results of previous studies that  have shown internal features of familiar faces to be  more useful for recognition than external features at  high resolution, we found that the two feature sets  reverse in importance as resolution decreases.

Manual measurement and configuration methods for obtaining location don't scale and are error-prone, and equipping sensors with GPS is often expensive and does not work in indoor and urban deployments. Sensor networks can therefore benefit from a self-configuring method where nodes cooperate with each other, estimate local distances to their neighbors, and converge to a consistent coordinate assignment. This paper describes a fully decentralized algorithm called AFL (Anchor-Free Localization) where nodes start from a random initial coordinate assignment and converge to a consistent solution using only local node interactions. The key idea in AFL is fold-freedom, where nodes first configure into a topology that resembles a scaled and unfolded version of the true configuration, and then run a force-based relaxation procedure. We show using extensive simulations under a variety of network sizes, node densities, and distance estimation errors that our algorithm is superior to previously proposed methods that incrementally compute the coordinate of nodes in the network, in terms of its ability to computer correct coordinates under a wider variety of conditions and its robuestness to measurement errors.",MIT-LCS-TR-892,Anchor-free Distributed Localization in Sensor Networks,,,,,,

The sensors themselves form a multihop wireless network communicatingwith one or more sensor access points (SAPs) that interface between application software and the sensor network. This paper addresses the problem of managing wireless network bandwidth and improving network capacity in a sensor network deployed as a shared infrastructure, concurrently used by different applications. Our bandwidth management architecture incorporates three ideas: first, we develop a simple rule system that allows applications and the network administrator to specify how traffic generated by sensors should be treated by the sensor network. Each rule is a function that maps a sensor data type and generated value to a transmission rate and a traffic class. Second, we show how using multiple SAPs and SAP selection method that considers packet loss probabilities, path load, and path lengths improves the capacity of the network and the performance of individual sensor streams. Third, we show that hopby- hop flow control, rather than end-to-end congestion control, is a better way to cope with the nature of sensor network traffic and avoids unnecessary packet losses that waste valuable wireless network bandwidth. Our experimental results from a 40-node indoor wireless sensor testbed show that these three techniques are simple to implement and allow scarce network bandwidth to be used efficiently.",MIT-LCS-TR-909,Bandwidth Management in Wireless Sensor Networks,,,,,,

We present Sift, a medium access protocol for wireless sensor networks designed with the above observations in mind. Sift is a randomized CSMA protocol, but unlike previous protocols, does not use a time-varying contention window from which a node randomly picks a transmission slot. Rather, to reduce the latency for the delivery of event reports, Sift uses a fixed-size contention window and a carefully-chosen, non-uniform probability distribution of transmitting in each slot within the window. We show using simulations that Sift can offer up to a 7-fold latency reduction compared to 802.11 as the size of the sensor network scales up to 500 nodes.

Unlike standard hash functions which take strings as input, multiset hash functions operate on multisets (or sets). They map multisets of arbitrary finite size to strings (hashes) of fixed length. They are incremental in that, when new members are added to the multiset, the hash can be updated in time proportional to the change. The functions may be multiset-collision resistant in that it is diÔøΩcult to find two multisets which produce the same hash, or just set-collision resistant in that it is diÔøΩcult to find a set and a multiset which produce the same hash. In particular, we introduce four multiset hash functions, each with its own advantages. MSet-XOR-Hash uses the XOR operation and is very eÔøΩcient; however, it uses a secret key and is only set-collision resistant. MSet-Add-Hash uses addition modulo a large integer and, thus, is slightly less eÔøΩcient than MSet-XOR-Hash; MSet-Add-Hash also uses a secret key but it is multiset-collision resistant. MSet-Mu-Hash uses finite field arithmetic and is not as eÔøΩcient as the other two hash functions; however, MSet-Mu-Hash is multiset-collision resistant, and unlike the other two hash functions, does not require a secret key. MSet-VAdd-Hash is more eÔøΩcient than MSet-Mu-Hash; it is also multiset-collision resistant, and does not use a secret key, but the hashes it produces are significantly longer than the hashes of the other functions. The proven security of MSet-XOR-Hash and MSet-Add-Hash is quantitative. We reduce the hardness of finding collisions to the hardness of breaking the underlying pseudorandom functions. The proven security of MSet-Mu-Hash is in the random oracle model and is based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. The proven security of MSet-VAdd-Hash is also in the random oracle model and is based on the hardness of the worst-case shortest vector problem.

Eppstein characterized minor-closed families of graphs with bounded local treewidth as precisely minor-closed families that minor-exclude an apex graph, where an apex graph has one vertex whose removal leaves a planar graph. In particular, Eppstein showed that all apex-minor-free graphs have bounded local treewidth, but his bound is doubly exponential in r, leaving open whether a tighter bound could be obtained.  We improve this doubly exponential bound to a linear bound, which is optimal. In particular, any minor-closed graph family with bounded local treewidth has linear local treewidth.
