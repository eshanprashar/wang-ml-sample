The generality of failure-detector theory, while providing great expressiveness, poses significant challenges in developing a robust hierarchy of failure detectors. We address some of these challenges by proposing (1) a variant of failure detectors called asynchronous failure detectors and (2) an associated modeling framework. Unlike the traditional failure-detector framework, our framework eschews real-time completely. We show that asynchronous failure detectors are sufficiently expressive to include several popular failure detectors including, but not limited to, the canonical Chandra-Toueg failure detectors, Sigma and other quorum failure detectors, Omega, anti-Omega, Omega^k, and Psi_k. Additionally, asynchronous failure detectors satisfy many desirable properties: they are self-implementable, guarantee that stronger asynchronous failure-detectors solve harder problems, and ensure that their outputs encode no information other than the set of crashed processes. We introduce the notion of a failure detector being representative for a problem to capture the idea that some problems encode the same information about process crashes as their weakest failure detectors do. We show that a large class of problems, called bounded problems, do not have representative failure detectors. Finally, we use the asynchronous failure-detector framework to show how sufficiently strong AFDs circumvent the impossibility of consensus in asynchronous systems.",47 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2013-025,http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/76716,Asynchronous Failure Detectors,2013-10-10T18:15:05Z,,,,,

However, autotuners themselves are rarely portable between projects, for a number of reasons: using a domain-informed search space representation is critical to achieving good results; search spaces can be intractably large and require advanced machine learning techniques; and the landscape of search spaces can vary greatly between different problems, sometimes requiring domain specific search techniques to explore efficiently. This paper introduces OpenTuner, a new open source framework for building domain-specific multi-objective program autotuners. OpenTuner supports fully-customizable configuration representations, an extensible technique representation to allow for domain-specific techniques, and an easy to use interface for communicating with the program to be autotuned. A key capability inside OpenTuner is the use of ensembles of disparate search techniques simultaneously; techniques that perform well will dynamically be allocated a larger proportion of tests. We demonstrate the efficacy and generality of OpenTuner by building autotuners for 6 distinct projects and 14 total benchmarks, showing speedups over prior techniques of these projects of up to 2.8x with little programmer effort.",13 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2013-026,,OpenTuner: An Extensible Framework for Program Autotuning,2013-11-01T20:30:03Z,"This work is partially supported by DOE award DE-SC0005288 and DOD DARPA award HR0011-10-9-0009.

From this comparison emerges a set of decision criteria that will enable a user to pick the library most suited to their purposes. I identify five deciding features: (1) availability of similarity metrics; (2) support for editing; (3) availability via Maven; (4) compatibility with retired Java versions; and (5) support for Enterprise Java. I also provide a comparison of other features of each library, the information exposed by each API, and the versions of Wordnet each library supports, and I evaluate each library for the speed of various retrieval operations. In the case that the user's application does not require one of the deciding features, I show that my library, JWI, the MIT Java Wordnet Interface, is the highest-performance, widest-coverage, easiest-to-use library available.",,,,Code for Java Libraries for Accessing the Princeton Wordnet: Comparison and Evaluation,2013-11-01T17:18:17Z,,Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,

Empirical measurements with a WiTrack prototype show that, on average, it localizes the center of a human body to within 10 to 13 cm in the x and y dimensions, and 21 cm in the z dimension. It also provides coarse tracking of body parts, identifying the direction of a pointing hand with a median of 11.2 degrees.

Examples include smart homes, smart cars, Mars rovers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous underwater vehicles. A common theme that all of these autonomous systems share is that in order to appropriately control them and prevent mission failure, they must be able to quickly estimate their internal state and the state of the world. A natural representation of many real world systems is to describe them in terms of a mixture of continuous and discrete variables. Unfortunately, hybrid estimation is typically intractable due to the large space of possible assignments to the discrete variables. In this thesis, we investigate how to incorporate conflict directed techniques from the consistency-based, model-based diagnosis community into a hybrid framework that is no longer purely consistency based. We introduce a novel search algorithm, A&#8727; with Bounding Conflicts, that uses conflicts to not only record infeasiblilities, but also learn where in the search space the heuristic function provided to the A&#8727; search is weak (possibly due to heavy to moderate sensor or process noise). Additionally, we describe a hybrid state estimation algorithm that uses this new search to perform estimation on hybrid discrete/continuous systems.",73 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2018-004,,"Fast, Approximate State Estimation of Concurrent Probabilistic Hybrid Automata",2018-01-30T23:46:03Z,,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,

We present and evaluate a technique for reliability-aware optimization of approximate computational kernel implementations. Our technique takes a standard implementation of a computation and automatically replaces some of its arithmetic operations with unreliable versions that consume less power, but may produce incorrect results with some probability. Our technique works with a developer-provided specification of the required reliability of a computation -- the probability that it returns the correct result -- and produces an unreliable implementation that satisfies that specification. We evaluate our approach on five applications from the image processing, numerical analysis, and financial analysis domains and demonstrate how our technique enables automatic exploration of the trade-off between the reliability of a computation and its performance.",11 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2014-001,,Reliability-Aware Optimization of Approximate Computational Kernels with Rely,2014-01-09T23:45:06Z,,,,,

Most previous work on cloud-bandwidth guarantees has assumed that cloud tenants know what bandwidth guarantees they want. However, application bandwidth demands can be complex and time-varying, and many tenants might lack sufficient information to request a bandwidth guarantee that is well-matched to their needs. A tenant's lack of accurate knowledge about its future bandwidth demands can lead to over-provisioning (and thus reduced cost-efficiency) or under-provisioning (and thus poor user experience in latency-sensitive user-facing applications). We analyze traffic traces gathered over six months from an HP Cloud Services datacenter, finding that application bandwidth consumption is both time-varying and spatially inhomogeneous. This variability makes it hard to predict requirements. To solve this problem, we develop a prediction algorithm usable by a cloud provider to suggest an appropriate bandwidth guarantee to a tenant. The key idea in the prediction algorithm is to treat a set of previously observed traffic matrices as ""experts"" and learn online the best weighted linear combination of these experts to make its prediction. With tenant VM placement using these predictive guarantees, we find that the inter-rack network utilization in certain datacenter topologies can be more than doubled.",13 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2014-004,,Cicada: Predictive Guarantees for Cloud Network Bandwidth,2014-03-31T20:15:06Z,,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/,networking; machine learning; traffic prediction,

This approach was used to implement Rubicon, a bounded verification system for Ruby on Rails web applications, in less than 1000 lines of Ruby code. Rubicon uses symbolic execution to derive verification conditions from Rails applications and an off-the-shelf solver to check them. Despite its small size, Rubicon has been used to find previously unknown bugs in open-source Rails applications. The key idea is to encode symbolic values and operations in a library written in the target language itself, overriding only a small part of the standard interpreter.
