In this paper we explore invariance to transformation and the role of layer-wise embeddings within an abstract framework of hierarchical kernels motivated by the visual cortex. Here a novel form of invariance is induced by propagating the effect of locally defined, invariant kernels throughout a hierarchy. We study this notion of invariance empirically. We then present an extension of the abstract hierarchical modeling framework to incorporate layer-wise embeddings, which we demonstrate can lead to improved generalization and scalable algorithms. Finally we analyze experimentally sample complexity properties as a function of architectural parameters.",9 p.,CBCL-290; MIT-CSAIL-TR-2010-035,artificial intelligence,Learning and Invariance in a Family of Hierarchical Kernels,,,,,

Recent work on Analog Network Coding (ANC) suggests a different approach, in which multiple interfering transmissions are strategically scheduled. The received collisions are collected and then used in a decoding process, such as the ZigZag decoding process, where the packets involved in the collisions are extracted. In this paper, we present an algebraic representation of collisions and describe a general approach to recovering collisions using ANC. To study the eect of using ANC on the performance of MAC layers, we develop an ANC-based algorithm that implements an abstract MAC layer service, as defined in [1, 2], and analyze its performance. This study proves that ANC can significantly improve the performance of MAC layer services, in terms of probabilistic time guarantees for packet delivery. We illustrate how this improvement at the MAC layer can translate into faster higher-level algorithms, by analyzing the time complexity of a multiple-message network-wide broadcast algorithm that uses our ANC-based MAC service.",19 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2010-036,,MAC Design for Analog Network Coding,,,,,

Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann Machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer ""pre-training"" phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pre-training also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that Deep Boltzmann Machines learn very good generative models of hand-written digits and 3-D objects. We also show that the features discovered by Deep Boltzmann Machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feed-forward neural nets which are then discriminatively fine-tuned.",32 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2010-037,Deep learning; Graphical models; Boltzmann Machines,An Efficient Learning Procedure for Deep Boltzmann Machines,,,,,

QuickStep deploys a set of parallelization transformations that together induce a search space of candidate parallel programs. Given a sequential program, representative inputs, and an accuracy requirement, QuickStep uses performance measurements, profiling information, and statistical accuracy tests on the outputs of candidate parallel programs to guide its search for a parallelizationthat maximizes performance while preserving acceptable accuracy. When the search completes, QuickStep produces an interactive report that summarizes the applied parallelization transformations, performance, and accuracy results for the automatically generated candidate parallel programs. In our envisioned usage scenarios, the developer examines this report to evaluate the acceptability of the final parallelization and to obtain insight into how the original sequential program responds to different parallelization strategies. Itis also possible for the developer (or even a user of the program who has no software development expertise whatsoever) to simply use the best parallelization out of the box without examining the report or further investigating the parallelization. Results from our benchmark set of applications show that QuickStep can automatically generate accurate and efficient parallel programs---the automatically generated parallel versions of five of our six benchmark applications run between 5.0 and 7.7 times faster on 8 cores than the original sequential versions. Moreover, a comparison with the Intel icc compiler highlights how QuickStep can effectively parallelize applications with features (such as the use of modern object-oriented programming constructs or desirable parallelizations with infrequent but acceptable data races) that place them inherently beyond the reach of standard approaches.",22 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2010-038,,Parallelizing Sequential Programs With Statistical Accuracy Tests,,,,,

To illustrate this approach, we use the abstract MAC Layer to study the new problem of Multi-Message Broadcast, a generalization of standard single-message broadcast in which multiple messages can originate at different times and locations in the network. We present and analyze two algorithms for Multi-Message Broadcast in static networks: a simple greedy algorithm and one that uses regional leaders.

This paper studies local graph traits and their relationship with global graph properties. Specifically, we focus on graph k-connectivity. First we prove a negative result that shows there does not exist a local graph trait which perfectly captures graph k-connectivity. We then present three different local graph traits which can be used to reliably predict the k-connectivity of a graph with varying degrees of accuracy. As a simple application of these results, we present upper and lower bounds for a local distributed algorithm which determines if a graph is k-connected. As a more elaborate application of local graph traits, we describe, and prove the correctness of, a local distributed algorithm that preserves k-connectivity in mobile ad hoc networks while allowing nodes to move independently whenever possible.",16 p,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2010-043,Connectivity; Graph Traits; Distributed,Reliably Detecting Connectivity using Local Graph Traits,,,,,

To correlate audit trail events of different system nodes we store event dependencies directly in the event records. Each audit trail record keeps links to its immediate predecessors.

One approach to relieving this burden is to make use of self-aware computing systems, which automatically adjust their behavior to help applications achieve their goals. This paper presents the SEEC framework, a unified computational model designed to enable self-aware computing in both applications and system software. In the SEEC model, applications specify goals, system software specifies possible actions, and the SEEC framework is responsible for deciding how to use the available actions to meet the application-specified goals.

In this paper we study the theoretical properties of hierarchical algorithms from a mathematical perspective. Our work is based on the framework of hierarchical architectures introduced by Smale et al. in the paper ""Mathematics of the Neural Response"", Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 2010. We propose a generalized definition of the neural response and derived kernel that allows us to integrate some of the existing hierarchical algorithms in practice into our framework. We then use this generalized definition to analyze the theoretical properties of hierarchical architectures. Our analysis focuses on three particular aspects of the hierarchy. First, we show that a wide class of architectures suffers from range compression; essentially, the derived kernel becomes increasingly saturated at each layer. Second, we show that the complexity of a linear architecture is constrained by the complexity of the first layer, and in some cases the architecture collapses into a single-layer linear computation. Finally, we characterize the discrimination and invariance properties of the derived kernel in the case when the input data are one-dimensional strings.
