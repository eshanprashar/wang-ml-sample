We first describe a 3-D face tracking technique based on real-time parametric motion-stereo, which is non-invasive, robust, and self-initialized. The tracker provides a real-time estimate of a ?frontal face ray? whose intersection with the display surface plane is used as a second stream of input for scrolling or pointing, in paral-lel with hand input. We evaluated the performance of com-bined head/hand input on a box selection and coloring task: users selected boxes with one pointer and colors with a second pointer, or performed both tasks with a single pointer. We found that performance with head and one hand was intermediate between single hand performance and dual hand performance. Our results are consistent with previously reported dual hand conflict in symmetric pointing tasks, and suggest that a head-based input stream should be used for asymmetric control.",1 p.; 1612360 bytes; 298580 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI,,,,

The main feature that distinguishes our algorithm from previous ones is that it allows for sampling along arbitrary viewing rays with no loss of efficiency. Using this property, we adaptively sample visual hulls to minimize the number of samples needed to attain a given fidelity. In our experiments, the number of samples can typically be reduced by an order of magnitude, resulting in a corresponding performance increase over previous algorithms.",,,,,,,,

Furthermore, shepherding guarantees that sandboxing checks around any type of program operation will never be bypassed.

Typical hybrid systems include computer components, which operate in discrete program steps, and real-world components, whose behavior over time intervals evolves according to physical constraints. Important examples of hybrid systems include automated transportation systems, robotics systems, process control systems, systems of embedded devices, and mobile computing systems. Such systems can be very complex, and very difficult to describe and analyze. This paper presents the Hybrid Input/Output Automaton (HIOA) modeling framework, a basic mathematical framework to support description and analysis of hybrid systems. An important feature of this model is its support for decomposing hybrid system descriptions. In particular, the framework includes a notion of external behavior for a hybrid I/O automaton, which captures its discrete and continuous interactions with its environment. The framework also defines what it means for one HIOA to implement another, based on an inclusion relationship between their external behavior sets, and defines a notion of simulation, which provides a sufficient condition for demonstrating implementation relationships. The framework also includes a composition operation for HIOAs, which respects external behavior, and a notion of receptiveness, which implies that an HIOA does not block the passage of time. The framework is intended to support analysis methods from both computer science and control theory. This work is a simplification of an earlier version of the HIOA model [49, 50]. The main simplification in the new model is a clearer separation between the mechanisms used to model discrete and continuous interaction between components. In particular, the new model removes the dual use of external variables for discrete and continuous interaction.",,,,,,,,

Unlike sequential programs with obscured dependence information and complex communication patterns, a stream program is naturally written as a set of concurrent filters with regular steady-state communication. The StreamIt language aims to provide a natural, high-level syntax that improves programmer productivity in the streaming domain. At the same time, the language imposes a hierarchical structure on the stream graph that enables novel representations and optimizations within the StreamIt compiler. We define the ""stream dependence function,"" a fundamental relationship between the input channels of two filters in a stream graph. We also describe a suite of stream optimizations, a denotational semantics for validating these optimizations, and a novel phased scheduling algorithm for stream graphs. In addition, we have implemented a prototype of the StreamIt optimizing compiler that is showing promising results.",,,,,,,,

Measurements of these networks show that the radio links between the majority of nodes have substantial loss rates. These loss rates are high enough to prevent existing ad hoc routing protocols from using the links. Link-level retransmission can mask high loss rates, at the cost of substantial decreases in throughput. Simulations, driven by the observed loss rates, show that the shortest paths chosen by existing routing protocols tend to find routes with much less capacity than is available along the best route. Based on these observations, we present a routing metric intended to allow routing protocols to find good routes in wireless ad hoc networks. The metric is the expected total number of transmissions required to deliver a packet along a route. This metric favors routes with high throughput and low total impact on spectrum. It is expected to perform better than existing techniques that eliminate links based on loss rate thresholds.",,,,,,,,

To address this issue, a number of emerging architectures contain replicated processing units with software-exposed communication between one unit and another (e.g., Raw, iWarp, SmartMemories). However, for their use to be widespread, it will be necessary to develop compiler technology that enables a portable, high-level language to execute efficiently across a range of wire-exposed architectures. In this paper, we describe our compiler for StreamIt: a high-level, architecture-independent language for streaming applications. We focus on our backend for the Raw processor. Though StreamIt exposes the parallelism and communication patterns of stream programs, much analysis is needed to adapt a stream program to a parallel stream processor. We describe fission and fusion transformations that can be used to adjust the granularity of a stream graph, a layout algorithm for mapping a stream graph to a given network topology, and a scheduling algorithm for generating a fine-grained static communication pattern for each computational element. We have implemented a fully functional compiler that parallelizes StreamIt applications for Raw, including several load-balancing optimizations. Using the cycle-accurate Raw simulator, we demonstrate that these optimizations can improve performance by up to 145%. We consider this work to be a first step towards a portable programming model for communication-exposed architectures.",,,,,,,,

(2001) recently studied the  nature of object representation in monkey  inferotemporal cortex using a combination of  optical imaging and extracellular recordings.  In particular, they examined IT neuron  responses to complex natural objects and  ""simplified"" versions thereof. In that study, in  42% of the cases, optical imaging revealed a  decrease in the number of activation patches  in IT as stimuli were ""simplified"". However, in  58% of the cases, ""simplification"" of the  stimuli actually led to the appearance of  additional activation patches in IT. Based on  these results, the authors propose a scheme  in which an object is represented by  combinations of active and inactive columns  coding for individual features.  We examine the patterns of activation caused  by the same stimuli as used by Tsunoda et al.  in our model of object recognition in cortex  (Riesenhuber 99). We find that object-tuned  units can show a pattern of appearance and  disappearance of features identical to the  experiment. Thus, the data of Tsunoda et al.  appear to be in quantitative agreement with a  simple object-based representation in which  an object's identity is coded by its similarities  to reference objects.
