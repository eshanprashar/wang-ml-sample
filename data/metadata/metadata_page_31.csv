Such excesses and abuses in the use of information are most commonly viewed through the lens of information security. This paper argues that debates over online privacy, copyright, and information policy questions have been overly dominated by the access restriction perspective. Our alternative is to design systems that are oriented toward information accountability and appropriate use, rather than information security and access restriction.

Normal anycast can be used to force the diffusion of attack traffic over a group of several hosts to increase the difficulty of saturating resources at or near any one of the hosts.  However, because a packet sent to the anycast group may be delivered to any member, anycast does not support protocols that require a group member to maintain state (such as TCP).  This makes anycast impractical for most applications of interest.This document describes the design of Stateful Anycast, a conceptual anycast-like network service based on IP anycast.  Stateful Anycast is designed to support stateful sessions without losing anycast’s ability to defend against DDoS attacks.  Stateful Anycast employs a set of anycasted proxies to direct packets to the proper stateholder.  These proxies provide DDoS protection by dropping a session’s packets upon group member request.  Stateful Anycast is incrementally deployable and can scale to support many groups.",103 p.,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Stateful Anycast for DDoS Mitigation,MEng thesis,,,,,,,

Theuse of mammalian expression data compendia for discovery of suchprograms presents several challenges, including: 1) cellularinhomogeneity within samples, 2) genetic and environmental variationacross samples, and 3) uncertainty in the numbers of programs andsample populations. We developed GeneProgram, a new unsupervisedcomputational framework that uses expression data to simultaneouslyorganize genes into overlapping programs and tissues into groups toproduce maps of inter-species expression programs, which are sortedby generality scores that exploit the automatically learnedgroupings.  Our method addresses each of the above challenges byusing a probabilistic model that: 1) allocates mRNA to differentexpression programs that may be shared across tissues, 2) ishierarchical, treating each tissue as a sample from a population ofrelated tissues, and 3) uses Dirichlet Processes, a non-parametricBayesian method that provides prior distributions over numbers ofsets while penalizing model complexity.  Using real gene expressiondata, we show that GeneProgram outperforms several popularexpression analysis methods in recovering biologically interpretablegene sets.  From a large compendium of mouse and human expressiondata, GeneProgram discovers 19 tissue groups and 100 expressionprograms active in mammalian tissues.  Our method automaticallyconstructs a comprehensive, body-wide map of expression programs andcharacterizes their functional generality. This map can be used forguiding future biological experiments, such as discovery of genesfor new drug targets that exhibit minimal ""cross-talk"" withunintended organs, or genes that maintain general physiologicalresponses that go awry in disease states.  Further, our method isgeneral, and can be applied readily to novel compendia of biologicaldata.",42 p.,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Based Models For Discovery of Cross-species Mammalian Gene Expression,,,,,,,,

Given few timing constraints, it computes a warp that both satisfies these constraints and maximizes local timing similarities to the reference.

In the future, more robots may be deployed in situations that require collaboration with humans, such as scientific exploration, search and rescue, hospital assistance, and even domestic care. These situations require robots to work together with humans, as part of a team, rather than as a stand-alone tool. The intent recognition capability is necessary for computational agents to play a more collaborative role in human-robot interactions, moving beyond the standard master-slave relationship of humans and computers today. We provide an innovative capability for recognizing human intent, through statistical plan learning and online recognition. We approach the plan learning problem by employing unsupervised learning to automatically determine the activities in a plan based on training data. The plan activities are described by a mixture of multivariate probability densities. The number of distributions in the mixture used to describe the data is assumed to be given. The training data trajectories are fed again through the activities' density distributions to determine each possible sequence of activities that make up a plan. These activity sequences are then summarized with temporal information in a temporal plan network, which consists of a network of all possible plans. Our approach to plan recognition begins with formulating the temporal plan network as a hidden Markov model. Next, we determine the most likely path using the Viterbi algorithm. Finally, we refer back to the temporal plan network to obtainpredicted future activities. Our research presents several innovations: First, we introduce a modified representation of temporal plan networks that incorporates probabilistic information into the state space and temporal representations. Second, we learn plans from actual data, such that the notion of an activity is not arbitrarily or manually defined, but is determined by the characteristics of the data. Third, we develop a recognition algorithm that can perform recognition continuously by making probabilistic updates. Finally, our recognizer not only identifies previously executed activities, but also predicts future activities based on the plan network. We demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithms on motion capture data. Our results show that the plan learning algorithm is able to generate reasonable temporal plan networks, depending on the dimensions of the training data and the recognition resolution used. The plan recognition algorithm is also successful in recognizing the correct activity sequences in the temporal plan network corresponding to the observed test data.",129 p.,MIT-CSAIL-TR-2018-008,Unsupervised Learning and Recognition of Physical Activity Plans,SM thesis,,,,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,2018-01-30T23:47:22Z,
