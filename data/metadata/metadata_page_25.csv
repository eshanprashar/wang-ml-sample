The system integrates all available features from multi-modal sources within a Bayesian framework. The framework allows representinga class of popular classifier combination rules and methods within a single formalism. It relies on a Â“per-classÂ” measure of confidence derived from performance of each classifier on training data that is shown to improve performance on a synthetic data set. The method is especially relevant in autonomous surveillance setting where varying time scales and missing features are a common occurrence.

Besides a significant growth in computational power, scanner performance, and storage facilities, this acceleration is partially due to an unprecedented increase in the amount of data sets accessible for researchers. Medical experts traditionally rely on manual comparisons of images, but the abundance of information now available makes this task increasingly difficult. Such a challenge prompts for more automation in processing the images.In order to carry out any sort of comparison among multiple medical images, onefrequently needs to identify the proper correspondence between them. This step allows us to follow the changes that happen to anatomy throughout a time interval, to identify differences between individuals, or to acquire complementary information from different data modalities. Registration achieves such a correspondence. In this dissertation we focus on the unified analysis and characterization of statistical registration approaches.We formulate and interpret a select group of pair-wise registration methods in the context of a unified statistical and information theoretic framework. This clarifies the implicit assumptions of each method and yields a better understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses. This guides us to a new registration algorithm that incorporates the advantages of the previously described methods. Next we extend the unified formulation with analysis of the group-wise registration algorithms that align a population as opposed to pairs of data sets. Finally, we present our group-wise registration framework, stochastic congealing. The algorithm runs in a simultaneous fashion, with every member of the population approaching the central tendency of the collection at the same time. It eliminates the need for selecting a particular referenceframe a priori, resulting in a non-biased estimate of a digital template. Our algorithm adopts an information theoretic objective function which is optimized via a gradientbased stochastic approximation process embedded in a multi-resolution setting. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance characteristics of stochastic congealing via experiments on both synthetic and real images.",152 p.; 254354390 bytes; 7278255 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,"population alignment, spatial normalization, congealing",A Unified Information Theoretic Framework for Pair- and Group-wise Registration of Medical Images,Eric Grimson,Vision,PhD thesis,

To replace this obsolete framework, we propose that issues of privacy protection currently viewed in terms of data access be re-conceptualized in terms of data use.  From a technology perspective, this requires supplementing legal and technical mechanisms for access control with new mechanisms for transparency and accountability of data use.

They also pro-vide a comparison confidence measure which indicates how well the measured im-age-based similarity approximates true physical similarity.  We also introduce novel clustering algorithms which use both similarity and comparison confidence. Based on the proposed similarity measures and clustering methods, a framework to learn semantic scene models by trajectory analysis is developed. Trajectories are first clustered into vehicles and pedestrians, and then further grouped based on spatial and velocity distributions. Different trajectory clusters represent different activities. The geometric and statistical models of structures in the scene, such as roads, walk paths, sources and sinks, are automatically learned from the trajectory clusters. Abnormal activities are detected using the semantic scene models.

This capability is useful for a number of applications, for instance robotic assembly, or robots with multiple manipulators, such as humanoid robots.Achieving reliable object transfer poses a number of challenges for both control and estimation. As with most manipulation problems, the inverse kinematics problem must be solved so that the desired endpoint location can be specified in Cartesian coordinates, rather than in the joint space of the manipulator. Anadditional challenge particular to the cooperative robotics problem is that more than one manipulator may have a grasp on the same object. Manipulators that are carrying out simple position control may encounter problems when grasping the same object. Minor errors in forward kinematics can lead to large controllerforces, or even unstable dynamics, as each controller tries to counteract the other to drive the perceived error to zero.On the estimation side, carrying out reliable transfer depends critically on determining the grasp state; in other words, does a particular robot have a grasp on the object, or do both have the object? The grasp state must be determined before the sequence of events in a transfer task can proceed. For example, the manipulator receiving the object cannot move away until it is certain that the manipulator passing the object has released. In many instances, having pressure sensors mounted in the hand is infeasible. For example, packaging reasons can mean that the necessary space is not available, as is the case with the JPL LEMUR hexapod. We therefore need to infer the grasp state from the available observations, which are usually supplied by position encoders at the joints.For this project we assume that each manipulator carries out estimation independently, without joint angle observations from the other robot, but with knowledge of its own joint angles and of the commands to be issued to both robots. This is typical of a multi-agent cooperative task, and the lack of observations makes the estimation task even more challenging.This report describes the approach we use to solve this problem, which is comprised of an impedance controller and a hybrid estimator.",19 p.; 21923202 bytes; 1004827 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,,Control and Estimation for Cooperative Manipulator Tasks,Brian Williams,Model-based Embedded and Robotic Systems,,

In many cases, the ability of such a detection scheme to distinguish between possible models for the system dynamics depends critically on the control inputs applied to the system. Prior work has therefore aimed to design control inputs in order to improve fault detection. We previously developed a new method that uses constrained finite horizon control design to create control inputs that minimize an upper bound on the probability of model selection error. This method is limited, however, to the problem of selection between two models. In this paper we describe a new method that extends this approach to handle an arbitrary number of models. By optimizing subject to hard constraints, the new method can ensure that a defined task is fulfilled, while optimally discriminating between models. This means that the discrimination power of the designed control input can be much greater than that created by other approaches, which typically design Â‘auxiliaryÂ’ signals with limited power so that the effect on the system state is small. Furthermore, the optimization criterion, which is an upper bound on the probability of model selection error, has a more meaningful interpretation than alternative approaches that are based on information gain, for example.We demonstrate the method using an aircraft fault detectionscenario and show that the new method significantly reducesthe bound on the probability of error when compared to amanually generated identification sequence and a fuel-optimalsequence.",6 p.; 11551717 bytes; 591011 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,,Finite Horizon Control Design for Optimal Discrimination between Several Models,Brian Williams,Model-based Embedded and Robotic Systems,,
