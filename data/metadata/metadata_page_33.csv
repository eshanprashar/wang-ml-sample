This research presents a preliminary model for measuring the resilience of medical records systemsagainst public policy goals and uses the model to illuminate the current state of medical record resilience. From this analysis, three recommendations for how to make medical records more resilient are presented.The recommendations are: 1) Federal and state governments should use the preliminary resiliencemodel introduced here as the basis for compliance requirements for electronicmedical record technical architectures. 2) Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs) should consideroffering services in disaster management to healthcare organizations. This willhelp RHIOs create sustainable business models. 3) Storage companies should consider developing distributed storagesolutions based on Distributed Hash Table (DHT) technology for medical recordstorage. Distributed storage would alleviate public concerns over privacy withcentralized storage of medical records.

The ideais to ignore certain ""low-level"" memory operations of anopen-nested transaction when detecting conflicts for its parenttransaction, and instead perform abstract concurrency control for the""high-level"" operation that nested transaction represents. Tosupport this methodology, TM systems use an open-nested commitmechanism that commits all changes performed by an open-nestedtransaction directly to memory, thereby avoiding low-levelconflicts. Unfortunately, because the TM runtime is unaware of thedifferent levels of memory, an unconstrained use of open-nestedcommits can lead to anomalous program behavior.In this paper, we describe a framework of ownership-awaretransactional memory which incorporates the notion of modules into theTM system and requires that transactions and data be associated withspecific transactional modules or Xmodules. We propose a newownership-aware commit mechanism, a hybrid between anopen-nested and closed-nested commit which commits a piece of datadifferently depending on whether the current Xmodule owns the data ornot. Moreover, we give a set of precise constraints on interactionsand sharing of data among the Xmodules based on familiar notions ofabstraction. We prove that ownership-aware TM has has cleanmemory-level semantics and can guarantee serializability bymodules, which is an adaptation of multilevel serializability fromdatabases to TM. In addition, we describe how a programmer canspecify Xmodules and ownership in a Java-like language. Our typesystem can enforce most of the constraints required by ownership-awareTM statically, and can enforce the remaining constraints dynamically.Finally, we prove that if transactions in the process of aborting obeyrestrictions on their memory footprint, the OAT model is free fromsemantic deadlock.",36 p.,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; ,Safe Open-Nested Transactions Through Ownership,"abstract serializability, open-nested transactions, ownership types, ownership-aware transactions, serializability by levels, serializability by modules, transactional memory, Xmodules",,

This capability is desirable because it allows information about parts and relationships in one object class to be generalized to other classes for which it is relevant. With this goal in mind, we have designed a representation and recognition framework that captures structural variability and shared part structure within and among object classes. The framework uses probabilistic geometric grammars (PGGs) to represent object classes recursively in terms of their parts, thereby exploiting the hierarchical and substitutive structure inherent to many types of objects. To incorporate geometric and appearance information, we extend traditional probabilistic context-free grammars to represent distributions over the relative geometric characteristics of object parts as well as the appearance of primitive parts. We describe an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for object categorization and localization in images given a PGG model. We also develop an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of a grammar structure from training data, and a search-based structure learning approach that finds a compact grammar to explain the image data while sharing substructure among classes. Finally, we describe a set of experiments that demonstrate empirically that the system provides a performance benefit.",28 p.,Massachusetts Institute of Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; ,Learning Grammatical Models for Object Recognition,,,

To transfer knowledge from previous related problems we observe that a category might be learnable using only a small subset of reference prototypes. Related problems may share a significant number of relevant prototypes; we find such a reduced representation by performing a joint loss minimization over the training sets of related problems with a shared regularization penalty that minimizes the total number of prototypes involved in the approximation.This optimization problem can be formulated as a linear program thatcan be solved efficiently.

Due to asynchrony, these collisions have different interference-free stretches at their start, which ZigZag uses to bootstrap its decoding.  ZigZag makes no changes to the 802.11 MAC and introduces no overhead when there are no collisions. But, when senders collide, ZigZag attains the same throughput as if the colliding packets were a priori scheduled in separate time slots. We build a prototype of ZigZag in GNU Radio.

The development of computational imaging is broadening this scope; a variety of unconventional cameras do not directly capture a traditional image anymore, but instead require the joint reconstruction of structure and image information. For example, recent coded aperture designs have been optimized to facilitate the joint reconstruction of depth and intensity. The breadth of imaging designs requires new tools to understand the tradeoffs implied by different strategies.This paper introduces a unified framework for analyzing computational imagingapproaches. Each sensor element is modeled as an inner product over the 4D light field. The imaging task is then posed as Bayesian inference: given the observed noisy light field projections and a new prior on light field signals, estimatethe original light field.
