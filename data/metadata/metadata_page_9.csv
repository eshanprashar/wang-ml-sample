Experiments on a 30 node network show that 95% of the files in a 13 MB dataset can be retrieved even when 7 of the nodes have failed. On top of this reliability, pStore includes support for file encryption, versioning, and secure sharing. Its custom versioning system permits arbitrary version retrieval similar to CVS. pStore provides this functionality at less than 10% of the network bandwidth and requires 85% less storage capacity than simpler local tape backup schemes for a representative workload.",,,,,,

Traditional computer vision systems cannot solve this problem at all. Recognizing surface reflectance properties from a single photograph is difficult because the observed image depends heavily on the amount of light incident from every direction. A mirrored sphere, for example, produces a different image in every environment. To make matters worse, two surfaces with different reflectance properties could produce identical images. The mirrored sphere simply reflects its surroundings, so in the right artificial setting, it could mimic the appearance of a matte ping-pong ball. Yet, humans possess an intuitive sense of what materials typically ""look like"" in the real world. This thesis develops computational algorithms with a similar ability to recognize reflectance properties from photographs under unknown, real-world illumination conditions.   Real-world illumination is complex, with light typically incident on a surface from every direction. We find, however, that real-world illumination patterns are not arbitrary. They exhibit highly predictable spatial structure, which we describe largely in the wavelet domain. Although they differ in several respects from the typical photographs, illumination patterns share much of the regularity described in the natural image statistics literature.   These properties of real-world illumination lead to predictable image statistics for a surface with given reflectance properties. We construct a system that classifies a surface according to its reflectance from a single photograph under unknown illuminination. Our algorithm learns relationships between surface reflectance and certain statistics computed from the observed image. Like the human visual system, we solve the otherwise underconstrained inverse problem of reflectance estimation by taking advantage of the statistical regularity of illumination. For surfaces with homogeneous reflectance properties and known geometry, our system rivals human performance.",AITR-2002-009,195 p.; 7366082 bytes; 3656634 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; illumination; reflectance; natural image statistics; vision; materials,

The spacecraft tasked with completing  these missions are becoming progressively more complex. This  increases the potential for mission failure due to hardware malfunctions  and unexpected spacecraft behavior. A solution to this problem lies in the  development of an advanced fault management system. Fault  management enables spacecraft to respond to failures and take repair  actions so that it may continue its mission. The two main approaches  developed for spacecraft fault management have been rule-based and  model-based systems. Rules map sensor information to system  behaviors, thus achieving fast response times, and making the actions of  the fault management system explicit. These rules are developed by  having a human reason through the interactions between spacecraft  components. This process is limited by the number of interactions a  human can reason about correctly. In the model-based approach, the  human provides component models, and the fault management system  reasons automatically about system wide interactions and complex fault combinations. This approach improves correctness, and makes explicit  the underlying system models, whereas these are implicit in the rule-based approach. We propose a fault detection engine, Compiled Mode  Estimation (CME) that unifies the strengths of the rule-based and model-based approaches. CME uses a compiled model to determine spacecraft  behavior more accurately. Reasoning related to fault detection is  compiled in an off-line process into a set of concurrent, localized  diagnostic rules. These are then combined on-line along with sensor  information to reconstruct the diagnosis of the system. These rules  enable a human to inspect the diagnostic consequences of CME.  Additionally, CME is capable of reasoning through component  interactions automatically and still provide fast and correct responses.  The implementation of this engine has been tested against the NEAR  spacecraft advanced rule-based system, resulting in detection of failures  beyond that of the rules. This evolution in fault detection will enable future  missions to explore the furthest reaches of the solar system without the  burden of human intervention to repair failed components.",AITR-2002-010,321 p.; 20495512 bytes; 7253655 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; mode estimation; compilation; model-based; reasoning; autonomy,

Real-time threads use immortal memory and region-based memory management to avoid unbounded pauses caused by interference from the garbage collector. The RTSJ uses runtime checks to ensure that deleting a region does not create dangling references and that real-time threads do not access references to objects allocated in the garbage-collected heap. This paper presents a static type system that guarantees that these runtime checks will never fail for well-typed programs. Our type system therefore 1) provides an important safety guarantee for real-time programs and 2) makes it possible to eliminate the runtime checks and their associated overhead. Our system also makes several contributions over previous work on region types. For object-oriented programs, it combines region types and ownership types in a unified type system framework. For multithreaded programs, it allows long-lived threads to share objects without using the heap and without having memory leaks. For real-time programs, it ensures that real-time threads do not interfere with the garbage collector. We have implemented several programs in our system. Our experience indicates that our type system is sufficiently expressive and requires little programming overhead. We also ran these programs on our RTSJ platform. Our experiments show that eliminating the RTSJ runtime checks using a static type system can significantly decrease the execution time of a real-time program.",,,,,,

This paper proposes new hardware schemes to verify the integrity of  untrusted external memory using a very small amount of trusted on-chip  storage. Our schemes maintain incremental multiset hashes of all memory  reads and writes at run-time, and can verify a {\\em sequence} of memory  operations at a later time. We study the advantages and disadvantages of  the two new schemes and two existing integrity checking schemes, MACs  and hash trees, when implemented in hardware in a microprocessor.  Simulations show that the new schemes outperform existing schemes of  equivalent functionality when integrity verification is infrequent.",,,,,,

Expressing the methods in a computer language forces them to be  unambiguous and computationally effective. The task of  formulating a method as a computer-executable program and debugging  that program is a powerful exercise in the learning process.

Our type system enables the developer to place a _token_ on each object; this token serves as the object's representative during the analysis and model extraction. The polymorphism in our type system enables the use of general-purpose classes whose instances may serve different purposes in the computation; programmers may also hide the details of internal data structures by placing the same token on all of the objects in these data structures.  Our combined type system and analysis provide the model extraction algorithms with sound heap aliasing information. Our algorithms can therefore extract both structural models that characterize object referencing relationships and behavioral models that capture indirect interactions mediated by objects in the heap. Previous approaches, in contrast, in the absence of aliasing information, have focused on control-flow interactions that take place at procedure call boundaries. We have implemented our type checker, analysis, and model extraction algorithms and used them to produce design models. Our experience indicates that it is straightforward to produce the token annotations and that the extracted models provide useful insight into the structure and behavior of the program.",,,,,,

Spatial architectures are architectures whose resources are organized in clusters, with non-zero communication delays between the clusters. On these architectures, instruction scheduling include both space scheduling, where instructions are mapped to clusters, and the traditional time scheduling. This paper considers the problem from both the theoretical and practical perspectives. It presents two integer linear program formulations with known performance bounds. We also present an 8-approximation algorithm for constant m and constant communication delays. Then, we introduce three heuristic algorithms based on list scheduling. Then we study a layer partitioning method. Our final algorithm is a combination of layer partitioning and the third heuristic. Two of the better algorithms are evaluated on the Raw machine. Results show that they are competitive with previously published results; for scientfici codes, our heuristics can perform an average of 25% better.",,,,,,

There exist inference algorithms for discrete approximations to  these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional  variables typically of interest, discrete inference becomes  infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle filters  provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail  to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing  many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized particle  filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a  nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm applicable to  general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure  to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous  likelihoods. The algorithm can accomodate an extremely broad class of  potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP  extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision  problems that graphical models can describe. We apply the NBP  algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face  model, allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features.",AIM-2002-020,10 p.; 3701870 bytes; 2537534 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; graphical model; belief propagation; nonparametric inference; vision,
