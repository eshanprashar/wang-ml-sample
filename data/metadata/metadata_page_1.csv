Computationally sound proofs provide, in a novel and meaningful framework, answer to old and new questions in complexity theory. In particular, given a random oracle or a new complexity assumption, they enable us to 1. prove that verifying is easier than deciding for all theorems; 2. provides a quite effective way to prove membership in computationally hard languages (such as C-NP-complete ones); and 3. show that every computation possesses a short certificate vouching its correctness. FInally, if a special type of computationally sound proof exists, we show that Blum's notion of program checking can be meaningfully broadened so as to prove that NP-complete languages are checkable.",,,,,

However, most of the currently available tools to an end system to perform such measurements are slow inaccurate and generate an excessive amount of probing traffic. This paper introduces entropy as a novel and efficient metric for discovering Internet path characteristics based on data collected by an end system. In particular, the paper presents an entropy-based technique that enables an end system to cluster flows it receives according to their shared bottleneck. Our mechanism relies solely on information extracted from the packets' inter-arrivals at the receiver. It does not generate any probing traffic and can use data extracted from both TCP and UDP flows. Moreover, it requires only a small number of packets from each flow, which makes it useful for short-lived flows. We report the result of running the algorithm on simulated data and Internet traffic.",,,,,

This paper examines a few of the possible microarchitectures that are capable of obtaining scalable ILP performance. First, we observe that the network that interconnects the processing elements is the critical design point in the microarchitecture. Next, we characterize four fundamental properties that have to be satisfied by the interconnection network. Next, we provide case studies of two different networks that satisfy these properties. Finally, a detailed evaluation of these networks is presented to highlight the scalability and performance of these microarchitectures. We show that by using compile time information, we can build simpler networks and use them efficiently.",,,,,

Correspondingly, modeling studies have often employed a 'grandmother'-type representation where the objects to be recognized were represented by individual units. However, objects in the natural world are commonly members of a class containing a number of visually similar objects, such as faces, for which physiology studies have provided support for a representation based on a sparse population code, which permits generalization from the learned exemplars to novel objects of that class. In this paper, we present results from psychophysical and modeling studies intended to investigate object recognition in natural ('continuous') object classes. In two experiments, subjects were trained to perform subordinate level discrimination in a continuous object class - images of computer-rendered cars - created using a 3D morphing system. By comparing the recognition performance of trained and untrained subjects we could estimate the effects of viewpoint-specific training and infer properties of the object class-specific representation learned as a result of training. We then compared the experimental findings to simulations, building on our recently presented HMAX model of object recognition in cortex, to investigate the computational properties of a population-based object class representation as outlined above. We find experimental evidence, supported by modeling results, that training builds a viewpoint- and class-specific representation that supplements a pre-existing repre-sentation with lower shape discriminability but possibly greater viewpoint invariance.",AIM-1682; CBCL-185,4110034 bytes; 1392514 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,

The core system finds  a certain class of objects in static images of  completely unconstrained, cluttered scenes  without using motion, tracking, or handcrafted  models and without making any assumptions  on the scene structure or the number of  objects in the scene. The system uses a set  of training data of positive and negative  example images as input, transforms the  pixel images to a Haar wavelet  representation, and uses a support vector  machine classifier to learn the difference  between in-class and out-of-class patterns.  To detect objects in out-of-sample images,  we do a brute force search over all the  subwindows in the image. This system is  applied to face, people, and car detection with  excellent results. For our extensions to video  sequences, we augment the core static  detection system in several ways -- 1)  extending the representation to five frames, 2)  implementing an approximation to a Kalman  filter, and 3) modeling detections in an image  as a density and propagating this density  through time according to measured features.  In addition, we present a real-time version of  the system that is currently running in a  DaimlerChrysler experimental vehicle. As part  of this thesis, we also present a system that,  instead of detecting full patterns, uses a  component-based approach. We find it to be  more robust to occlusions, rotations in depth,  and severe lighting conditions for people  detection than the full body version. We also  experiment with various other representations  including pixels and principal components  and show results that quantify how the  number of features, color, and gray-level affect  performance.",AITR-1685; CBCL-186,128 p.; 72537763 bytes; 15910731 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,AI; MIT; Artificial Intelligence; object detection; pattern recognition; people detection; face detection; car detection

The second part of the paper describes a component-based method for face detection consisting of a two-level hierarchy of SVM classifers. On the first level, component classifers independently detect components of a face, such as the eyes, the nose, and the mouth. On the second level, a single classifer checks if the geometrical configuration of the detected components in the image matches a geometrical model of a face.",AIM-1687; CBCL-187,6267853 bytes; 482304 bytes,application/postscript; application/pdf,en_US,

Applied to a router configuration, these techniques have high-level results---for example, optimizing the router or verifying its high-level properties. This paper describes several programming language techniques that have been useful in practice, including optimization tools that remove virtual function calls from router definitions and remove redundant parts of adjacent routers.
