The core system finds  a certain class of objects in static images of  completely unconstrained, cluttered scenes  without using motion, tracking, or handcrafted  models and without making any assumptions  on the scene structure or the number of  objects in the scene. The system uses a set  of training data of positive and negative  example images as input, transforms the  pixel images to a Haar wavelet  representation, and uses a support vector  machine classifier to learn the difference  between in-class and out-of-class patterns.  To detect objects in out-of-sample images,  we do a brute force search over all the  subwindows in the image. This system is  applied to face, people, and car detection with  excellent results. For our extensions to video  sequences, we augment the core static  detection system in several ways -- 1)  extending the representation to five frames, 2)  implementing an approximation to a Kalman  filter, and 3) modeling detections in an image  as a density and propagating this density  through time according to measured features.  In addition, we present a real-time version of  the system that is currently running in a  DaimlerChrysler experimental vehicle. As part  of this thesis, we also present a system that,  instead of detecting full patterns, uses a  component-based approach. We find it to be  more robust to occlusions, rotations in depth,  and severe lighting conditions for people  detection than the full body version.

We investigate this problem through the fabrication and simple control of a planar 2-DOF robotic finger inspired by anatomic consistency, self-containment, and adaptability. The robot is equipped with a tactile sensor array based on optical transducer technology whereby localized changes in light intensity within an illuminated foam substrate correspond to the distribution and magnitude of forces applied to the sensor surface plane.   The integration of tactile perception is a key component in realizing robotic systems which organically interact with the world. Such natural behavior is characterized by compliant performance that can initiate internal, and respond to external, force application in a dynamic environment. However, most of the current manipulators that support some form of haptic feedback either solely derive proprioceptive sensation or only limit tactile sensors to the mechanical fingertips. These constraints are due to the technological challenges involved in high resolution, multi-point tactile perception.

In the process of using reinforcement learning to build an adaptive electronic market-maker, we find the sparsity of data, the partial observability of the domain, and the multiple objectives of the agent to cause serious problems for existing reinforcement learning algorithms.  We employ importance sampling (likelihood ratios) to achieve good performance in partially observable Markov decision processes with few data. Our importance sampling estimator requires no knowledge about the environment and places few restrictions on the method of collecting data.

Unlike the majority of robotic systems interacting with soil, our objective is parameter estimation, not excavation. To this end, we design our manipulator with a flat plate for easy modeling of interactions. By using a flat plate, we take advantage of the wealth of research on the similar problem of earth pressure on retaining walls.  There are a number of existing earth pressure models. These models typically provide estimates of force which are in uncertain relation to the true force. A recent technique, known as numerical limit analysis, provides upper and lower bounds on the true force. Predictions from the numerical limit analysis technique are shown to be in good agreement with other accepted models.  Experimental methods for plate insertion, soil-tool interface friction estimation, and control of applied forces on the soil are presented. In addition, a novel graphical technique for inverting the soil models is developed, which is an improvement over standard nonlinear optimization. This graphical technique utilizes the uncertainties associated with each set of force measurements to obtain all possible parameters which could have produced the measured forces.  The system is tested on three cohesionless soils, two in a loose state and one in a loose and dense state. The results are compared with friction angles obtained from direct shear tests. The results highlight a number of key points. Common assumptions are made in soil modeling. Most notably, the Mohr-Coulomb failure law and perfectly plastic behavior. In the direct shear tests, a marked dependence of friction angle on the normal stress at low stresses is found. This has ramifications for any study of friction done at low stresses. In addition, gradual failures are often observed for vertical tools and tools inclined away from the direction of motion.

Type-alpha DPLs allow for lucid proof presentation and for efficient proof checking, but not for proof search.  Type-omega DPLs allow for search as well as simple presentation and checking, but termination is no longer guaranteed and  proof checking may diverge. We do not study type-omega DPLs here.   We start by listing some common characteristics of DPLs. We  then illustrate with a particularly simple example: a toy  type-alpha DPL called PAR, for deducing parities. We present the abstract syntax of PAR, followed by two  different kinds of formal semantics: evaluation and denotational.  We then relate the two semantics and show how proof checking  becomes tantamount to evaluation. We proceed to develop the  proof theory of PAR, formulating and studying certain  key notions such as observational equivalence that pervade all DPLs.

LCF-type systems such as HOL offer similar guarantees, but their soundness relies heavily on static type systems. By contrast, DPLs  ensure soundness dynamically, through their evaluation semantics; no type system is necessary. This is possible owing to a novel two-tier syntax  that separates deductions from computations, and to the abstraction of assumption bases, which is factored into the semantics of the language and allows for sound evaluation.   Every type-omega DPL properly contains a type-alpha DPL, which can be used to present proofs in a lucid and detailed form, exclusively in terms of primitive inference rules. Derived inference rules are expressed  as user-defined methods, which are ""proof recipes"" that take arguments  and dynamically perform appropriate deductions. Methods arise naturally  via parametric abstraction over type-alpha proofs. In that light, the  evaluation of a method call can be viewed as a computation that carries  out a type-alpha deduction. The type-alpha proof ""unwound"" by such a method  call is called the ""certificate"" of the call. Certificates can be checked  by exceptionally simple type-alpha interpreters, and thus they are useful  whenever we wish to minimize our trusted base.   Methods are statically closed over lexical environments, but dynamically scoped over assumption bases. They can take other methods as arguments, they can iterate, and they can branch conditionally. These capabilities,  in tandem with the bifurcated syntax of type-omega DPLs and their dynamic assumption-base semantics, allow the user to define methods in  a style that is disciplined enough to ensure soundness yet fluid enough  to permit succinct and perspicuous expression of arbitrarily sophisticated derived inference rules.   We demonstrate every major feature of type-omega DPLs by defining and studying NDL-omega, a higher-order, lexically scoped, call-by-value type-omega DPL for classical zero-order natural deduction---a simple choice that allows us to focus on type-omega syntax and semantics rather than on the subtleties of the underlying logic. We start by illustrating how type-alpha DPLs naturally lead to type-omega DPLs by way of abstraction; present the formal syntax and semantics of NDL-omega; prove several results about it, including soundness; give numerous examples of methods; point out connections to the lambda-phi calculus, a very general framework for type-omega DPLs; introduce a notion of computational and deductive cost; define several instrumented interpreters for computing such costs and for generating certificates; explore the use of type-omega DPLs as general programming languages; show that DPLs do not have to be type-less by formulating a static Hindley-Milner polymorphic type system for NDL-omega; discuss some idiosyncrasies of type-omega DPLs such as the potential divergence of proof checking; and compare type-omega DPLs to other approaches to proof presentation and discovery.

The spacecraft tasked with completing  these missions are becoming progressively more complex. This  increases the potential for mission failure due to hardware malfunctions  and unexpected spacecraft behavior. A solution to this problem lies in the  development of an advanced fault management system. Fault  management enables spacecraft to respond to failures and take repair  actions so that it may continue its mission. The two main approaches  developed for spacecraft fault management have been rule-based and  model-based systems. Rules map sensor information to system  behaviors, thus achieving fast response times, and making the actions of  the fault management system explicit. These rules are developed by  having a human reason through the interactions between spacecraft  components. This process is limited by the number of interactions a  human can reason about correctly.

There exist inference algorithms for discrete approximations to  these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional  variables typically of interest, discrete inference becomes  infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle filters  provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail  to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing  many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized particle  filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a  nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm applicable to  general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure  to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous  likelihoods.

We describe here our  scheme and its application to a new video-realistic  (potentially indistinguishable from real recorded video)  visual-speech animation system, called Mary 101.  Two types of experiments were performed: a)  distinguishing visually between real and synthetic  image- sequences of the same utterances, (""Turing  tests"") and b) gauging visual speech recognition by  comparing lip-reading performance of the real and  synthetic image-sequences of the same utterances  (""Intelligibility tests"").  Subjects that were presented randomly with either real  or synthetic image-sequences could not tell the  synthetic from the real sequences above chance level.  The same subjects when asked to lip-read the  utterances from the same image-sequences  recognized speech from real image-sequences  significantly better than from synthetic ones. However,  performance for both, real and synthetic, were at levels  suggested in the literature on lip-reading. We conclude  from the two experiments that the animation of Mary  101 is adequate for providing a percept of a talking  head. However, additional effort is required to improve  the animation for lip-reading purposes like  rehabilitation and language learning.  In addition, these two tasks could be considered as  explicit and implicit perceptual discrimination tasks. In  the explicit task (a), each stimulus is classified directly  as a synthetic or real image-sequence by detecting a  possible difference between the synthetic and the real  image-sequences.

images by using representations that adapt to the anatomy found in such
images.

 images of anatomical structures typically have uniform intensity interiors
and smooth boundaries. we create methods to represent such regions
compactly using tetrahedra.  unlike voxel-based representations, tetrahedra
can accurately describe the expected smooth surfaces of medical
objects. furthermore, the interior of such objects can be represented using
a small number of tetrahedra. rather than describing a medical object using
tens of thousands of voxels, our representations generally contain only a few
thousand elements.

tetrahedra facilitate the creation of efficient non-rigid registration
algorithms based on finite element methods (fem).  we create a fast,
fem-based method to non-rigidly register segmented anatomical structures
from two subjects. using our compact tetrahedral representations, this
method generally requires less than one minute of processing time on a desktop
pc.

we also create a novel method for the non-rigid registration of gray scale
images. to facilitate a fast method, we create a tetrahedral representation
of a displacement field that automatically adapts to both the anatomy in an
image and to the displacement field.  the resulting algorithm has a
computational cost that is dominated by the number of nodes in the mesh
(about 10,000), rather than the number of voxels in an image (nearly
10,000,000). for many non-rigid registration problems, we can find a
transformation from one image to another in five minutes. this speed is
important as it allows use of the algorithm during surgery.

we apply our algorithms to find correlations between the shape of
anatomical structures and the presence of schizophrenia. we show that a
study based on our representations outperforms studies based on other
representations. we also use the results of our non-rigid registration
algorithm as the basis of a segmentation algorithm. that algorithm also
outperforms other methods in our tests, producing smoother segmentations
and more accurately reproducing manual segmentations.",high performance computing

While tuning properties of the cells in early part of the ventral visual stream, thought to be responsible for object recognition in the primate, are comparatively well understood, several different theories have been proposed regarding tuning in higher visual areas, such as V4. We used the model of object recognition in cortex presented by Riesenhuber and Poggio (1999), where more complex shape tuning in higher layers is the result of combining afferent inputs tuned to simpler features, and compared the tuning properties of model units in intermediate layers to those of V4 neurons from the literature. In particular, we investigated the issue of shape representation in visual area V1 and V4 using oriented bars and various types of gratings (polar, hyperbolic, and Cartesian), as used in several physiology experiments.

To generate plans, Spock must be able to piece together vehicle commands and team tactics that have a complex behavior represented by concurrent processes.  This is in contrast to traditional planners, whose operators represent simple atomic or durative actions.  Spock represents operators using the RMPL language, which describes behaviors using parallel and sequential compositions of state and activity episodes.  RMPL is useful for controlling mobile autonomous missions because it allows mission designers to quickly encode expressive activity models using object-oriented design methods and an intuitive set of activity combinators.  Spock also is significant in that it uniformly represents operators and plan-space processes in terms of Temporal Plan Networks, which support temporal flexibility for robust plan execution.

Three types of visual features, geometric blur, C1 and SIFT, are used to generate feature descriptors.  These feature descriptors are then used to find point correspondences between pairs of images.  Various morphable models are created by small subsets of these correspondences using thin-plate spline.  Given these morphs, a simple algorithm, least median of squares (LMEDS), is used to find the best morph.  A scoring metric, using both LMEDS and distance transform, is used to classify test images based on a nearest neighbor algorithm.  We perform the experiments on the Caltech 101 dataset [5].

Currently such scripts are mostly hand-generated by human operators. This introduces inefficiency, puts a significant cognitive burden on the engineers, and prevents re-planning in response to environment disturbances or plan execution failure. For discrete systems, the field of autonomy has elevated the level of commanding by developing goal-directed systems, to which human operators specify a series of temporally extended goals to be accomplished, and the goal-directed systems automatically output the correct, executable command sequences. Increasingly, the control of autonomous systems involves performing actions with a mix of discrete and continuous effects. For example, a typical autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mission involves discrete actions, like get GPS and take sample, and continuous actions, like descend and ascend, which are influenced by the dynamical model of the vehicle. A hybrid planner generates a sequence of discrete and continuous actions that achieve the mission goals. In this thesis, I present a novel approach to solve the generative planning problem for temporally extended goals for hybrid systems, involving both continuous and discrete actions. The planner, Kongming, incorporates two innovations. First, it employs a compact representation of all hybrid plans, called a Hybrid Flow Graph, which combines the strengths of a Planning Graph for discrete actions and Flow Tubes for continuous actions. Second, it engages novel reformulation schemes to handle temporally flexible actions and temporally extended goals.

In the space domain, execution of temporally flexible plans has provided an enabler for achieving the desired coordination and robustness, in the context of space probes and planetary rovers, modeled as discrete systems. We address the challenge of extending plan execution to systems with continuous dynamics, such as air vehicles and robot manipulators, and that are controlled indirectly through the setting of continuous state variables.Systems with continuous dynamics are more challenging than discrete systems, because they require continuous, low-level control, and cannot be controlled by issuing simple sequences of discrete commands. Hence, manually controlling these systems (or plants) at a low level can become very costly, in terms of the number of human operators necessary to operate the plant. For example, in the case of a fleet of UAVs performing a search-and-rescue scenario, the traditional approach to controlling the UAVs involves providing series of close waypoints for each aircraft, which incurs a high workload for the human operators, when the fleet consists of a large number of vehicles.Our solution is a novel, model-based executive, called Sulu, that takes as input a qualitative state plan, specifying the desired evolution of the state of the system. This approach elevates the interaction between the human operator and the plant, to a more abstract level where the operator is able to Â“coachÂ” the plant by qualitatively specifying the tasks, or activities, the plant must perform. These activities are described in a qualitative manner, because they specify regions in the plantÂ’s state space in which the plant must be at a certain point in time. Time constraints are also described qualitatively, in the form of flexible temporal constraints between activities in the state plan. The design of low-level control inputs in order to meet this abstract goal specification is then delegated to the autonomous controller, hence decreasing the workload per human operator. This approach also provides robustness to the executive, by giving it room to adapt to disturbances and unforeseen events, while satisfying the qualitative constraints on the plant state, specified in the qualitative state plan.Sulu reasons on a model of the plant in order to dynamically generate near-optimal control sequences to fulfill the qualitative state plan. To achieve optimality and safety, Sulu plans into the future, framing the problem as a disjunctive linear programming problem.

The alternative is to prototype simulations in a high-level language like Matlab, thereby sacrificing performance. The Matlab programming model naturally describes the behavior of an entire physical system using the language of linear algebra. However, simulations also manipulate individual geometric elements, which are best represented using linked data structures like meshes. Translating between the linked data structures and linear algebra comes at significant cost, both to the programmer and the machine. High-performance implementations avoid the cost by rephrasing the computation in terms of linked or index data structures, leaving the code complicated and monolithic, often increasing its size by an order of magnitude.

STNUs are in particular notable because they facilitate reasoning over stochastic, or uncontrollable, actions and their corresponding durations. To evaluate the feasibility of a set of constraints associated with an STNU, one checks the network's \textit{dynamic controllability}, which determines whether an adaptive schedule can be constructed on-the-fly. Our work provides a dynamic controllability checker that is able to quickly refute the controllability of an STNU with integer bounds, such as those found in planning problems.

Because our analysis extracts a precise representation of the region of the heap that each method may access, it is able to provide useful information even for methods with externally visible side effects. In particular, it can recognize read-only parameters (a parameter is read-only if the method does not mutate any objects transitively reachable from the parameter) and safe parameters (a parameter is safe if it is read-only and the method does not create any new externally visible paths in the heap to objects transitively reachable from the parameter).

Autonomous robots with a keen sensitivity to risk can be trusted with critical missions, such as exploring deep space and assisting on the battlefield. We introduce a novel, risk-minimizing approach to program execution that utilizes program flexibility and estimation of risk in order to make runtime decisions that minimize the probability of program failure. Our risk-minimizing executive, called Murphy, utilizes two forms of program flexibility, 1) flexible scheduling of activity timing, and 2) redundant choice between subprocedures, in order to minimize two forms of program risk, 1) exceptions arising from activity failures, and 2) exceptions arising from timing constraint violations in a program. Murphy takes two inputs, a program written in a nondeterministic variant of the Reactive Model-based Programming Language (RMPL) and a set of stochastic activity failure models, one for each activity in a program, and computes two outputs, a risk-minimizing decision policy and value function. The decision policy informs Murphy which decisions to make at runtime in order to minimize risk, while the value function quantifies risk. In order to execute with low latency, Murphy computes the decision policy and value function offline, as a compilation step prior to program execution. In this thesis, we develop three approaches to RMPL program execution. First, we develop an approach that is guaranteed to minimize risk. For this approach, we reason probabilistically about risk by framing program execution as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Next, we develop an approach that avoids risk altogether. For this approach, we frame program execution as a novel form of constraint-based temporal reasoning. Finally, we develop an execution approach that trades optimality in risk avoidance for tractability. For this approach, we leverage prior work in hierarchical decomposition of MDPs in order to mitigate complexity.

Here, we introduce Network Maximal Correlation (NMC) as a fundamental measure to capture nonlinear associations in networks without the knowledge of underlying nonlinearity shapes. NMC infers, possibly nonlinear, transformations of variables with zero means and unit variances by maximizing total nonlinear correlation over the underlying network. For the case of having two variables, NMC is equivalent to the standard Maximal Correlation. We characterize a solution of the NMC optimization using geometric properties of Hilbert spaces for both discrete and jointly Gaussian variables. For discrete random variables, we show that the NMC optimization is an instance of the Maximum Correlation Problem and provide necessary conditions for its global optimal solution. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm based on Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) which converges to a local NMC optimum. For this algorithm, we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate starting points to jump out of local maximizers. We also propose a distributed algorithm to compute a 1-$\epsilon$ approximation of the NMC value for large and dense graphs using graph partitioning. For jointly Gaussian variables, under some conditions, we show that the NMC optimization can be simplified to a Max-Cut problem, where we provide conditions under which an NMC solution can be computed exactly. Under some general conditions, we show that NMC can infer the underlying graphical model for functions of latent jointly Gaussian variables. These functions are unknown, bijective, and can be nonlinear. This result broadens the family of continuous distributions whose graphical models can be characterized efficiently. We illustrate the robustness of NMC in real world applications by showing its continuity with respect to small perturbations of joint distributions. We also show that sample NMC (NMC computed using empirical distributions) converges exponentially fast to the true NMC value. Finally, we apply NMC to different cancer datasets including breast, kidney and liver cancers, and show that NMC infers gene modules that are significantly associated with survival times of individuals while they are not detected using linear association measures.",,48 p.,,,,Computational Biology (Kellis),,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,,,,,,,,,2015-09-23T19:00:07Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,1008,"network maximal correlation identifying nonlinear relationships in large datasets is a daunting task particularly when the form of the nonlinearity is unknown. here, we introduce network maximal correlation (nmc) as a fundamental measure to capture nonlinear associations in networks without the knowledge of underlying nonlinearity shapes. nmc infers, possibly nonlinear, transformations of variables with zero means and unit variances by maximizing total nonlinear correlation over the underlying network. for the case of having two variables, nmc is equivalent to the standard maximal correlation. we characterize a solution of the nmc optimization using geometric properties of hilbert spaces for both discrete and jointly gaussian variables. for discrete random variables, we show that the nmc optimization is an instance of the maximum correlation problem and provide necessary conditions for its global optimal solution. moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternating conditional expectation (ace) which converges to a local nmc optimum. for this algorithm, we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate starting points to jump out of local maximizers. we also propose a distributed algorithm to compute a 1-$\epsilon$ approximation of the nmc value for large and dense graphs using graph partitioning. for jointly gaussian variables, under some conditions, we show that the nmc optimization can be simplified to a max-cut problem, where we provide conditions under which an nmc solution can be computed exactly. under some general conditions, we show that nmc can infer the underlying graphical model for functions of latent jointly gaussian variables. these functions are unknown, bijective, and can be nonlinear. this result broadens the family of continuous distributions whose graphical models can be characterized efficiently. we illustrate the robustness of nmc in real world applications by showing its continuity with respect to small perturbations of joint distributions. we also show that sample nmc (nmc computed using empirical distributions) converges exponentially fast to the true nmc value. finally, we apply nmc to different cancer datasets including breast, kidney and liver cancers, and show that nmc infers gene modules that are significantly associated with survival times of individuals while they are not detected using linear association measures.",language models

Let Sigma be a language consisting of function symbols (representing type constructors) and C a decidable structure in the relational language L containing a binary relation <. C represents primitive types; < represents a subtype ordering.  We introduce the notion of Sigma-term-power of C, which generalizes the structure arising in structural subtyping.  The domain of the Sigma-term-power of C is the set of Sigma-terms over the set of elements of C.   We show that the decidability of the first-order theory of C implies the decidability of the first-order theory of the Sigma-term-power of C.  This result implies the decidability of the first-order theory of structural subtyping of non-recursive types.

Teleoperation is a common interface for controlling robots that are designed to be human proxies. Unfortunately, teleoperation may fail to preserve the natural fluidity of human motions due to interface limitations such as communication delays, non-immersive sensing, and controller uncertainty. I envision a robot that can learn a set of motions that a teleoperator commonly performs, so that it can autonomously execute routine tasks or recognize a user's motion in real time. Tasks can be either primitive activities or compound plans. During online operation, the robot can recognize a user's teleoperated motions on the fly and offer real-time assistance, for example, by autonomously executing the remainder of the task. I realize this vision by addressing three main problems: (1) learning primitive activities by identifying significant features of the example motions and generalizing the behaviors from user demonstration trajectories; (2) recognizing activities in real time by determining the likelihood that a user is currently executing one of several learned activities; and (3) learning complex plans by generalizing a sequence of activities, through auto-segmentation and incremental learning of previously unknown activities. To solve these problems, I first present an approach to learning activities from human demonstration that (1) provides flexibility and robustness when encoding a user's demonstrated motions by using a novel representation called a probabilistic flow tube, and (2) automatically determines the relevant features of a motion so that they can be preserved during autonomous execution in new situations. I next introduce an approach to real-time motion recognition that (1) uses temporal information to successfully model motions that may be non-Markovian, (2) provides fast real-time recognition of motions in progress by using an incremental temporal alignment approach, and (3) leverages the probabilistic flow tube representation to ensure robustness during recognition against varying environment states. Finally, I develop an approach to learn combinations of activities that (1) automatically determines where activities should be segmented in a sequence and (2) learns previously unknown activities on the fly. I demonstrate the results of autonomously executing motions learned by my approach on two different robotic platforms supporting user-teleoperated manipulation tasks in a variety of environments. I also present the results of real-time recognition in different scenarios, including a robotic hardware platform.

However, a significant problem is that system administrators need to be able to automatically verify whether their policies capture the intended security goals. To address this important problem, researchers have proposed many automated verification techniques. Despite considerable progress in verification techniques, scalability is still a significant issue. Hence, in this paper we propose that error finding complements verification, and is a fruitful way of checking whether or not access control policies implement the security intent of system administrators. Error finding is more scalable (at the cost of completeness), and allows for the use of a wider variety of techniques. In this paper, we describe an abstraction-refinement based technique and its implementation, the Mohawk tool, aimed at finding errors in ARBAC access-control policies. The key insight behind our abstraction-refinement technique is that it is more efficient to look for errors in an abstract policy (with successive refinements, if necessary) than its complete counterpart. Mohawk accepts as input an access-control policy and a safety question. If Mohawk finds an error in the input policy, it terminates with a sequence of actions that cause the error.

These extensions consist primarily of a set of short-vector instructions that apply the same opcode to a vector of operands. Vector instructions introduce a data-parallel component to processors that exploit instruction-level parallelism, and present an opportunity for increased performance. In fact, ignoring a processor's vector opcodes can leave a significant portion of the available resources unused. In order for software developers to find short-vector instructions generally useful, however, the compiler must target these extensions with complete transparency and consistent performance. This paper describes selective vectorization, a technique for balancing computation across a processor's scalar and vector units. Current approaches for targeting short-vector instructions directly adopt vectorizing technology first developed for supercomputers. Traditional vectorization, however, can lead to a performance degradation since it fails to account for a processor's scalar resources. We formulate selective vectorization in the context of software pipelining. Our approach creates software pipelines with shorter initiation intervals, and therefore, higher performance. A key aspect of selective vectorization is its ability to manage transfer of operands between vector and scalar instructions.

As with most manipulation problems, the inverse kinematics problem must be solved so that the desired endpoint location can be specified in Cartesian coordinates, rather than in the joint space of the manipulator. Anadditional challenge particular to the cooperative robotics problem is that more than one manipulator may have a grasp on the same object.

Minor errors in forward kinematics can lead to large controllerforces, or even unstable dynamics, as each controller tries to counteract the other to drive the perceived error to zero.On the estimation side, carrying out reliable transfer depends critically on determining the grasp state; in other words, does a particular robot have a grasp on the object, or do both have the object?

Moreover, when a user makes a query, any server hosting the database can answer the query, and provide a very short proof P that the answer is well-defined, unique, and consistent with c (and hence with D).  One potential application of consistent query protocols is for guaranteeing the consistency of many replicated copies of D---the owner can publish c, and users can verify the consistency of a query to some copy of D by making sure P is consistent with c.  This strong guarantee holds even for owners who try to cheat, while creating c.  The task of consistent query protocols was originally proposed for membership queries by Micali and Rabin, and subsequently and independently, by Kilian. In this setting a server can prove to a client whether or not a given key is present or not in a database, based only on a short public commitment c.  We strengthen their results in several ways. For membership queries, we improve the communication complexity; more importantly, we provide protocols for more general types of queries and more general relational databases.  For example, we consider databases in which entries have several keys and where we allow range queries (e.g. we allow a client to ask for all entries within a certain age range and a certain salary range).   Towards this goal, we introduce query algorithms with certain inherent robustness properties---called data-robust algorithms---and show how this robustness can be achieved. In particular, we illustrate our general technique by constructing an efficient data-robust algorithm for proving consistency of orthogonal range queries (a particular case of a ``join''query).  The server's proof convinces the client not only that all the matching entries provided are in D, but also that no others are present.  Our guarantees hold even if the answer is the empty set.  In the case of one-dimensional range queries we also show a new data-hiding technique---called explicit hashing---which allows us to a execute consistent query protocol P and at the same time protect the privacy of all other information in the database efficiently.

Few techniques, however, are capable of generating motions that are consistent with physically simulated environments. Physically simulated characters, in contrast, are automatically consistent with the environment, but their motionsare often unnatural because they are difficult to control. We present a model-predictive controller that yields natural motions by guiding simulated humans toward real motion data. During simulation, the predictive component of the controller solves a quadratic program to compute the forces for a short window of time into the future. These forces are then applied by a low-gain proportional-derivative component, which makes minor adjustments until the next planning cycle.

Examples of this class include the foundational problems of pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) (in robotics), camera motion estimation (in computer vision), and sensor network localization (in distributed sensing), among others. This inference problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the special Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem defined on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. Finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync is capable of recovering certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.",,"49 pages, 20 figures",,,Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); Maximum-likelihood estimation; Convex relaxation; Low-rank semidefinite programming; Riemannian optimization,Marine Robotics,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-02-07T23:00:06Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,1038,"se-sync: a certifiably correct algorithm for synchronization over the special euclidean group many important geometric estimation problems naturally take the form of synchronization over the special euclidean group: estimate the values of a set of unknown poses given noisy measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms. examples of this class include the foundational problems of pose-graph simultaneous localization and mapping (slam) (in robotics), camera motion estimation (in computer vision), and sensor network localization (in distributed sensing), among others. this inference problem is typically formulated as a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to solve in general. nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the special euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. the crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact mle so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. we develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem defined on a low-dimensional riemannian manifold, and then design a riemannian truncated-newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. finally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, se-sync. experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph slam datasets shows that se-sync is capable of recovering certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and does so more than an order of magnitude faster than the gauss-newton-based approach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.",robotics

Whileresearchers have identified many uses of spatial conjunction, its precise expressive powercompared to traditional logical constructs was not previously known.In this paper we establish the expressive power of spatial conjunction. We construct anembedding from first-order logic with spatial conjunction into second-order logic, and moresurprisingly, an embedding from full second order logic into first-order logic with spatialconjunction.

Besides a significant growth in computational power, scanner performance, and storage facilities, this acceleration is partially due to an unprecedented increase in the amount of data sets accessible for researchers. Medical experts traditionally rely on manual comparisons of images, but the abundance of information now available makes this task increasingly difficult. Such a challenge prompts for more automation in processing the images.In order to carry out any sort of comparison among multiple medical images, onefrequently needs to identify the proper correspondence between them. This step allows us to follow the changes that happen to anatomy throughout a time interval, to identify differences between individuals, or to acquire complementary information from different data modalities. Registration achieves such a correspondence. In this dissertation we focus on the unified analysis and characterization of statistical registration approaches.We formulate and interpret a select group of pair-wise registration methods in the context of a unified statistical and information theoretic framework. This clarifies the implicit assumptions of each method and yields a better understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses. This guides us to a new registration algorithm that incorporates the advantages of the previously described methods. Next we extend the unified formulation with analysis of the group-wise registration algorithms that align a population as opposed to pairs of data sets. Finally, we present our group-wise registration framework, stochastic congealing.

We present a new technique for verifying commutativity conditions, which are logical formulas that characterize when operations commute. Because our technique reasons with the abstract state of verified linked data structure implementations, it can verify commuting operations that produce semantically equivalent (but not identical) data structure states in different execution orders. We have used this technique to verify sound and complete commutativity conditions for all pairs of operations on a collection of linked data structure implementations, including data structures that export a set interface (ListSet and HashSet) as well as data structures that export a map interface (AssociationList, HashTable, and ArrayList). This effort involved the specification and verification of 765 commutativity conditions. Many speculative parallel systems need to undo the effects of speculatively executed operations. Inverse operations, which undo these effects, are often more efficient than alternate approaches (such as saving and restoring data structure state).

To fulfill these roles, teams of autonomous robots will need to cooperate together to accomplish complex mission objectives in uncertain and dynamic environments. In these environments, autonomous robots face a host of new challenges, such as responding robustly to timing uncertainties and perturbations, task and coordination failures, and equipment malfunctions. In order to address these challenges, this thesis advocates a novel planning approach, called temporally-flexible contingent planning. A temporally-flexible contingent plan is a compact encoding of methods for achieving the mission objectives which incorporates robustness through flexible task durations, redundant methods, constraints on when methods are applicable, and preferences between methods. This approach enables robots to adapt to unexpected changes on-the-fly by selecting alternative methods at runtime in order to satisfy as best possible the mission objectives. The drawback to this approach, however, is the computational overhead involved in selecting alternative methods at runtime in response to changes. If a robot takes too long to select a new plan, it could fail to achieve its near-term mission objectives and potentially incur damage. To alleviate this problem, and extend the range of applicability of temporally-flexible contingent planning to more demanding real-time systems, this thesis proposes a temporally-flexible contingent plan executive that selects new methods quickly and optimally in response to changes in a robot's health and environment. We enable fast and optimal method selection through two complimentary approaches. First, we frame optimal method selection as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) variant, called an Optimal Conditional CSP (OCCSP). Second, we extend fast CSP search algorithms, such as Dynamic Backtracking and Branch-and-Bound Search, to solve OCCSPs.

Understanding how the visual cortex wires up through development and how visual experience refines connections into adulthood is a key question for Neuroscience. While computational models of the visual cortex are becoming increasingly detailed, the question of how such architecture could self-organize through visual experience is often overlooked. Here we focus on the class of hierarchical feedforward models of the ventral stream of the visual cortex, which extend the classical simple-to-complex cells model by Hubel and Wiesel (1962) to extra-striate areas, and have been shown to account for a host of experimental data. Such models assume two functional classes of simple and complex cells with specific predictions about their respective wiring and resulting functionalities.In these networks, the issue of learning, especially for complex cells, is perhaps the least well understood. In fact, in most of these models, the connectivity between simple and complex cells is not learned butrather hard-wired. Several algorithms have been proposed for learning invariances at the complex cell level based on a trace rule to exploit the temporal continuity of sequences of natural images, but very few can learn from natural cluttered image sequences.Here we propose a new variant of the trace rule that only reinforces the synapses between the most active cells, and therefore can handle cluttered environments. The algorithm has so far been developed and tested at the level of V1-like simple and complex cells: we verified that Gabor-like simple cell selectivity could emerge from competitive Hebbian learning.
