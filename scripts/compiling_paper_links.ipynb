    "1. Using the URL provided and the year in the prompt, we get the first HTML page for scraping. This implementation is handled in _getfirstpagehtml_\n",
    "2. For the page, we scrape all the research paper links (20 at a time) and save them in a csv along with their metadata link, which can be constructed with slight modification and has \"?show=full\" at the end. This is handled in _getlinksfromhtml_\n",
    "3. Finally, we move on to the next page, and repeat step 2. This implementation is handled in _scrapemetadatalinks_\n",
    "\n",
    "This design gives flexibility to the user and allows to pressure test implementation piece by piece. Further, by downloading links page by page, which can always be aggregated later, we can isolate manual checks on certain pages too. "
